Company Match helps you resolve companies by name and location, and run company semantic search by keyword or theme. Use it to normalize company data, enrich records, or find companies that match search criteria.

### What you can do

- **Resolve** — Send a company name and location (e.g., state, city, country); get back matching companies with identifiers and firmographic fields. Use this to confirm or disambiguate a single company.
- **Company semantic search** — Search by keyword and optional location filters to get a list of matching companies. Use this for prospecting or building lists.

### Typical flow

1. **Resolve** — When you have a company name and location, call the resolve endpoint with those criteria. Adjust `result_count` if you need more or fewer matches.
2. **Company semantic search** — When you’re searching by theme or keyword, use the company semantic search endpoint with a keyword and optional location filters. Results include company identifiers and attributes you can use for enrichment or targeting.
