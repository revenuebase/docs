## Company Match overview

Company Match helps you resolve and discover companies by name and location. Use it to normalize company data, enrich records, or find companies that match search criteria.

### What you can do

- **Resolve** — Send a company name and location (e.g., state, city, country); get back matching companies with identifiers and firmographic fields. Use this to confirm or disambiguate a single company.
- **Discover** — Search by keyword and optional location filters to get a list of matching companies. Use this for prospecting or building lists.

### Typical flow

1. **Resolve** — When you have a company name and location, call the resolve endpoint with those criteria. Adjust `result_count` if you need more or fewer matches.
2. **Discover** — When you’re searching by theme or keyword, use the discovery endpoint with a keyword and optional location filters. Results include company identifiers and attributes you can use for enrichment or targeting.

### Endpoints in this section

The pages below describe each endpoint’s parameters and responses. Use the API playground on any page to try requests with your API key.
