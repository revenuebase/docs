## Rate limits

The RevenueBase API uses rate limits to ensure fair usage. Limits are applied per API key.

| Limit type        | Default  | Notes                    |
| ----------------- | -------- | ------------------------ |
| Requests per minute | 60    | Per API key              |
| Requests per day    | 10,000  | Resets at midnight UTC   |

When you exceed a limit, the API returns `429 Too Many Requests`. Include a short delay or use exponential backoff before retrying.

### Rate limit headers

Responses may include:

- **X-RateLimit-Limit** — Max requests allowed in the window.
- **X-RateLimit-Remaining** — Requests left in the current window.
- **X-RateLimit-Reset** — Unix timestamp when the window resets.

## Error codes

| HTTP status | Meaning           | What to do                                      |
| ----------- | ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| 400         | Bad Request       | Check request body and parameters.               |
| 401         | Unauthorized      | Verify your API key and `x-key` header.          |
| 403         | Forbidden         | Key valid but not allowed for this resource.     |
| 404         | Not Found         | Endpoint or resource does not exist.             |
| 422         | Validation Error  | Fix the fields listed in the response `detail`. |
| 429         | Too Many Requests | Respect rate limits; retry after backoff.       |
| 500         | Server Error      | Retry with backoff; contact support if it persists. |

### Validation errors (422)

Validation errors return a JSON body with a `detail` array describing each issue:

```json
{
  "detail": [
    {
      "loc": ["body", "email"],
      "msg": "value is not a valid email address",
      "type": "value_error.email"
    }
  ]
}
```

Use `loc` and `msg` to fix the request and retry.
