## Authentication

All RevenueBase API requests are authenticated with an API key sent in a header.

You can try any endpoint in the **API playground** on each endpoint page: enter your API key when prompted, then send requests and view responses directly in the docs.

### API key (header)

Send your API key in the **x-key** header on every request:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.revenuebase.ai/v1/credits" \
  -H "x-key: YOUR_API_KEY"
```

### Getting an API key

1. Sign in to the [RevenueBase dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com).
2. Go to **Settings** → **API Keys**.
3. Click **Create API key** and copy the value. You cannot view it again after creation.

### Security practices

- **Keep keys secret** — Do not commit API keys to version control or expose them in client-side or mobile apps.
- **Use server-side only** — Call the API from your backend or trusted environment.
- **Rotate if exposed** — If a key may be compromised, create a new key and revoke the old one in the dashboard.

### Multiple keys

You can create multiple API keys (for example, per environment or service). Each key has its own rate limits and usage. Revoke keys you no longer need from the dashboard.
