## API Reference overview

The RevenueBase API lets you validate emails, run batch processing, and resolve company data programmatically. All endpoints use the same base URL and API key authentication.

<Info>
  **Create an account first.** You need a RevenueBase account to use the API. If you don't have one, go to [https://app.revenuebase.ai/](https://app.revenuebase.ai/) to create an account, then get your API key from the dashboard.
</Info>

### Base URL

```
https://api.revenuebase.ai
```

### What you can do

- **User operations** — Check credits and manage API keys.
- **Email processing** — Real-time email validation and batch upload, status, and download.
- **Company resolver** — Resolve and discover company information by name and location.

### Getting started

1. Get an API key from the dashboard (**Settings** → **API Keys**).
2. Send it in the **x-key** header on every request.
3. Use the [Authentication](/api-reference/authentication) page for details, then try endpoints in the API playground on each endpoint page.
