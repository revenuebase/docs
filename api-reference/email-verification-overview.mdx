Use the Email Verification API to validate email addresses in real time or in batch. You can check a single email instantly or upload a file of addresses and process them asynchronously.

### What you can do

- **Real-time verification** — Send one email at a time and get an immediate result (deliverability, role, risk, and more).
- **Batch processing** — Upload a file of email addresses; the API queues the job and returns a process ID. Poll for status and download results when ready.
- **Queue management** — List queued or in-progress batch jobs and cancel them if needed.

### Typical flow

1. **Single email** — Call the real-time endpoint with the email; use the response in your app.
2. **Batch** — Upload a file or submit a batch request to get a `process_id`. Poll the status endpoint until the job completes, then call the download endpoint to retrieve the results.

### Endpoints in this section
