## Table B

**Table B** is a sample table in the RevenueBase data feeds. Replace this description with your real table (e.g., contacts or related entities).

### What it is

Table B holds related records that link to Table A (or another parent table). For example, it might represent contacts, events, or child entities. Each row typically has a foreign key to the parent table.

### What's in it

| Column      | Type     | Description                    |
| ----------- | -------- | ------------------------------ |
| id          | bigint   | Unique primary key.            |
| table_a_id  | bigint   | Foreign key to Table A.        |
| email       | string   | Contact or identifier.        |
| created_at  | timestamp| When the record was created.  |

Update columns to match your actual schema. Use the [Data dictionary](/data-feeds/data-dictionary) for full definitions.

### How to use it

- **Joining to Table A** — Use `table_b.table_a_id = table_a.id`. See [Joining tables](/data-feeds/joining-tables).
- **Filtering** — Filter by id, table_a_id, or date columns as needed.

### Example query

```sql
SELECT b.id, b.email, a.name AS company_name
FROM table_b b
JOIN table_a a ON a.id = b.table_a_id
LIMIT 100;
```

Replace table and column names with your real schema.
