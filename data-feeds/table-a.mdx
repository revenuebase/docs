## Table A

**Table A** is a sample table in the RevenueBase data feeds. Replace this description with your real table (e.g., companies or another core entity).

### What it is

Table A holds core entity records — for example, companies or organizations. Each row is one entity with a unique identifier and attributes such as name, location, and metadata.

### What's in it

| Column      | Type     | Description                    |
| ----------- | -------- | ------------------------------ |
| id          | bigint   | Unique primary key.            |
| name        | string   | Display name of the entity.    |
| created_at  | timestamp| When the record was created.   |
| updated_at  | timestamp| Last update time (UTC).       |

Add or replace columns to match your actual schema. Use the [Data dictionary](/data-feeds/data-dictionary) for full field definitions.

### How to use it

- **Filtering** — Use `WHERE` on id, name, or date columns as needed.
- **Joining** — Other tables (e.g., Table B) may reference `table_a.id`. See [Joining tables](/data-feeds/joining-tables).

### Example query

```sql
SELECT id, name, created_at
FROM table_a
WHERE updated_at >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '7 days'
LIMIT 100;
```

Adjust table and column names to your real schema.
