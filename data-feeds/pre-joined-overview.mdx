## Pre-Joined Tables overview

Pre-Joined Tables are ready-made views that combine multiple base tables (e.g., People/Contacts, Companies, Insights) so you can query them without writing joins yourself. Use them when you need a single table that already links people, companies, and optional insight data.

### What you get

- **Fewer joins** — Query one table instead of joining Contacts, Companies, and Insights manually.
- **Consistent keys** — Join keys and relationships are defined and documented for each pre-joined view.
- **Easier analytics** — Start with [People + Companies](/data-feeds/people-companies) or [People + Companies + Insights](/data-feeds/people-companies-insights) and filter or aggregate as needed.

### Available pre-joined views

| View                        | Description                                          |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| [People + Companies](/data-feeds/people-companies) | Contacts joined to Companies (one row per contact).  |
| [People + Companies + Insights](/data-feeds/people-companies-insights) | Contacts, Companies, and Insights in one view.       |

### When to use which

- **People + Companies** — When you need contact and company attributes together (e.g., contact email + company name) without insight fields.
- **People + Companies + Insights** — When you also need insight or score fields on the same row.

For custom joins or other combinations, use the base tables and [Joining tables](/data-feeds/joining-tables).
