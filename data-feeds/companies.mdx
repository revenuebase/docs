---

The `companies` table contains organization-level records with firmographic data. Use it for account targeting, ICP filtering, segmentation, and enriching your CRM with company-level attributes. One row per company; join to contacts and insights via `company_id`.

## Where the data comes from

Company records are built from public company profiles, websites, regulatory filings, and third-party data providers. Industry and size are normalized for consistent filtering. Location and financials are updated with each release; fill rates for revenue and funding are higher for public and venture-backed companies.

## Company counts by region

The map below shows current company counts by country. Use it to understand coverage and plan account-based campaigns by region.

## Data dictionary & fill rates

Fill rate is the percentage of rows where a field is non-null. Rates vary by segment (e.g. US and public companies often have higher fill rates for financials and industry).

### Identifiers

| Field | Type | Fill rate | Description |
|-------|------|-----------|-------------|
| `company_id` | VARCHAR | 100% | Unique RevenueBase identifier for the company |
| `domain` | VARCHAR | _TODO_% | Primary web domain (e.g., `acme.com`) |
| `linkedin_url` | VARCHAR | _TODO_% | Company LinkedIn page URL |
| `crunchbase_url` | VARCHAR | _TODO_% | Crunchbase profile URL |
| `ticker` | VARCHAR | _TODO_% | Stock ticker symbol (public companies only) |

### Company basics

| Field | Type | Fill rate | Description |
|-------|------|-----------|-------------|
| `company_name` | VARCHAR | _TODO_% | Legal or common company name |
| `description` | TEXT | _TODO_% | Short company description |
| `founded_year` | INTEGER | _TODO_% | Year the company was founded |
| `company_type` | VARCHAR | _TODO_% | `public`, `private`, `nonprofit`, `government`, `education` |
| `website` | VARCHAR | _TODO_% | Full website URL |

| `naics_code` | VARCHAR | _TODO_% | North American Industry Classification code |
| `sector` | VARCHAR | _TODO_% | High-level sector grouping |

### Size & financials

| Field | Type | Fill rate | Description |
|-------|------|-----------|-------------|
| `employee_count` | INTEGER | _TODO_% | Estimated number of employees |
| `employee_range` | VARCHAR | _TODO_% | Bucketed range: `1-10`, `11-50`, `51-200`, `201-500`, `501-1000`, `1001-5000`, `5001-10000`, `10000+` |
| `revenue_estimate` | FLOAT | _TODO_% | Estimated annual revenue in USD |
| `revenue_range` | VARCHAR | _TODO_% | Bucketed range: `$0-1M`, `$1-10M`, `$10-50M`, `$50-100M`, `$100-500M`, `$500M-1B`, `$1B+` |

| `last_funding_round` | VARCHAR | _TODO_% | Most recent funding round type (e.g., `Series B`) |
| `last_funding_date` | DATE | _TODO_% | Date of most recent funding round |

<Info>Use **employee_range** when you need stable buckets for segmentation or reporting; use **employee_count** when you need numeric filters (e.g. `BETWEEN 100 AND 500`). Both refer to the same underlying estimate.</Info>

### Addresses (headquarters)

Headquarters address fields describe the **company’s primary office location**. Use them for territory assignment, regional targeting, compliance, or direct mail.

| Field | Type | Fill rate | Description |
|-------|------|-----------|-------------|
| `hq_street` | VARCHAR | _TODO_% | Street address (number and street name) |
| `hq_city` | VARCHAR | _TODO_% | City |
| `hq_state` | VARCHAR | _TODO_% | State or province |
| `hq_zip` | VARCHAR | _TODO_% | Postal or ZIP code |
| `hq_country` | VARCHAR | _TODO_% | Country (ISO 2-letter code) |
| `hq_country_name` | VARCHAR | _TODO_% | Country (full name) |
| `hq_region` | VARCHAR | _TODO_% | Geographic region (e.g., `North America`, `EMEA`) |

<Tip>**hq_street** is useful for direct mail and enrichment; **hq_city**, **hq_state**, and **hq_country** are the most commonly filled and are best for regional filters. **hq_region** is derived and useful for high-level territory reporting.</Tip>

### Technology

| Field | Type | Fill rate | Description |
|-------|------|-----------|-------------|
| `tech_stack` | ARRAY | _TODO_% | Detected technologies used by the company |
| `primary_language` | VARCHAR | _TODO_% | Primary programming language (tech companies) |
| `cloud_provider` | VARCHAR | _TODO_% | Primary cloud provider: `aws`, `azure`, `gcp`, `other` |

<Warning>**tech_stack** is a nested/array field. In SQL, use your warehouse’s array functions to filter (e.g. `ARRAY_CONTAINS`, `LIST_CONTAINS`, or unnest and join). Syntax varies by platform (Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift).</Warning>

### Metadata

| Field | Type | Fill rate | Description |
|-------|------|-----------|-------------|
| `created_at` | TIMESTAMP | 100% | When this record was first added to RevenueBase |
| `updated_at` | TIMESTAMP | 100% | When this record was last modified |
| `data_source` | VARCHAR | _TODO_% | Primary data source for this record |

<Warning>**Fill rates are approximate** and vary by segment. US-based and public companies tend to have higher fill rates for revenue, funding, and industry. International and private companies may have lower fill rates on financials.</Warning>

## Joining this table

Join **companies** to **contacts** on `company_id` to attach firmographics to people. Join to **insights** on `company_id` to attach buying signals and technographics.

### Companies + contacts (accounts with decision-makers)

```sql
SELECT
    co.company_id,
    co.company_name,
    co.domain,
    co.industry,
    co.employee_count,
    COUNT(c.contact_id) AS contact_count
FROM companies co
JOIN contacts c ON c.company_id = co.company_id
WHERE co.industry = 'Software'
  AND co.employee_count BETWEEN 50 AND 500
  AND c.email_verified = TRUE
GROUP BY co.company_id, co.company_name, co.domain, co.industry, co.employee_count
HAVING COUNT(c.contact_id) >= 1;
```

### Companies + insights (firmographics + signals)

```sql
SELECT
    co.company_name,
    co.domain,
    co.industry,
    co.employee_count,
    i.insight_type,
    i.technologies_detected,
    i.is_hiring,
    i.recent_funding
FROM companies co
LEFT JOIN insights i ON co.company_id = i.company_id AND i.contact_id IS NULL
WHERE co.employee_count BETWEEN 100 AND 1000;
```

<Note>Filter insights with `contact_id IS NULL` when you want company-level signals only; otherwise you may get multiple rows per company (one per contact-level insight).</Note>

## How to calculate fill rates

Use this pattern to compute fill rates for any field or segment. Replace the sample fields with the columns you care about.

```sql
SELECT
    COUNT(*) AS total_records,
    ROUND(COUNT(domain) * 100.0 / COUNT(*), 1) AS domain_fill_pct,
    ROUND(COUNT(industry) * 100.0 / COUNT(*), 1) AS industry_fill_pct,
    ROUND(COUNT(employee_count) * 100.0 / COUNT(*), 1) AS employee_count_fill_pct,
    ROUND(COUNT(revenue_estimate) * 100.0 / COUNT(*), 1) AS revenue_fill_pct,
    ROUND(COUNT(hq_country) * 100.0 / COUNT(*), 1) AS hq_country_fill_pct
FROM companies;
```

## Sample queries

### Find target accounts by ICP (mid-size software in the US)

**What you’re finding:** Companies that match your ideal customer profile so you can build an account list or sync to a CRM.

**Why these fields:** `industry` and `employee_count` define ICP; `revenue_range` adds budget signal. `hq_city` and `hq_state` support territory or regional campaigns. We select only the columns you’d need for account creation or routing.

**Logic:** Filter by industry, size band, country, and revenue band. Order by `employee_count` to prioritize larger accounts within the band.

```sql
SELECT
    company_name,
    domain,
    industry,
    employee_count,
    revenue_range,
    hq_city,
    hq_state
FROM companies
WHERE industry IN ('Software', 'Information Technology')
  AND employee_count BETWEEN 50 AND 500
  AND hq_country = 'US'
  AND revenue_range IN ('$10-50M', '$50-100M')
ORDER BY employee_count DESC;
```

### Check fill rates for a segment

**What you’re finding:** How complete key fields are for a subset (e.g. one industry or region) so you know what to expect when building lists.

**Why these fields:** Same as the global fill-rate query, but with a `WHERE` clause so percentages reflect only the segment you care about.

```sql
SELECT
    COUNT(*) AS total_records,
    ROUND(COUNT(domain) * 100.0 / COUNT(*), 1) AS domain_fill_pct,
    ROUND(COUNT(industry) * 100.0 / COUNT(*), 1) AS industry_fill_pct,
    ROUND(COUNT(employee_count) * 100.0 / COUNT(*), 1) AS employee_count_fill_pct,
    ROUND(COUNT(revenue_estimate) * 100.0 / COUNT(*), 1) AS revenue_fill_pct
FROM companies
WHERE hq_country = 'US'
  AND industry = 'Software';
```
