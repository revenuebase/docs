## Example queries

### Find target accounts by ICP

```sql
SELECT
    company_name,
    domain,
    industry,
    employee_count,
    revenue_range,
    hq_city,
    hq_state
FROM companies
WHERE industry IN ('Software', 'Information Technology')

  AND hq_country = 'US'
  AND revenue_range IN ('$10-50M', '$50-100M')
ORDER BY employee_count DESC;
```

### Check fill rates yourself

```sql
-- Calculate actual fill rates for any field
SELECT
    COUNT(*) as total_records,
    ROUND(COUNT(domain) * 100.0 / COUNT(*), 1) as domain_fill_pct,
    ROUND(COUNT(industry) * 100.0 / COUNT(*), 1) as industry_fill_pct,
    ROUND(COUNT(employee_count) * 100.0 / COUNT(*), 1) as employee_count_fill_pct,
    ROUND(COUNT(revenue_estimate) * 100.0 / COUNT(*), 1) as revenue_fill_pct
