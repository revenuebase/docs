## Introduction

The **Companies** table holds organization records — businesses you can link to contacts, insights, and other tables. Each row is one company with a unique identifier and firmographic attributes. Use this table for company-level analytics and as the main join target across Dynamic Data Feeds.

## What it is

Companies are the primary entity table for organizations. Each row has a unique ID and attributes such as name, location, and industry. [Contacts](/data-feeds/contacts) and other tables reference Companies via `company_id`. Use this table when you need organization-level data or when joining people and insights to companies.

## Data coverage

Companies data covers organizations in the RevenueBase universe. Coverage varies by region and industry; the map below illustrates geographic availability.

## Data updates

Companies data is updated on a regular schedule. New and changed records are reflected in the feed according to your plan’s refresh cadence. Historical snapshots are not retained by default; contact support or check your agreement for retention and update frequency details.
