---

The `companies` table contains organization-level records with firmographic data. Use it for account targeting, ICP filtering, segmentation, and enriching your CRM with company-level attributes. One row per company; join to contacts and insights via `company_id`.

## Where the data comes from

Company records are built from public company profiles, websites, regulatory filings, and third-party data providers. Industry and size are normalized for consistent filtering. Location and financials are updated with each release; fill rates for revenue and funding are higher for public and venture-backed companies.

## Company counts by region

The map below shows current company counts by country. Use it to understand coverage and plan account-based campaigns by region.

## Joining this table

Join **ORG_LATEST** to **PER_LATEST** on `RBID = RBID_ORG` to attach firmographics to people. Join to **INSIGHTS_LATEST** on `RBID = RBID_ORG` to attach buying signals and technographics.

### Companies + contacts (accounts with decision-makers)

```sql
SELECT
    co.RBID,
    co.COMPANY_NAME,
    co.DOMAIN,
    co.INDUSTRY_LINKEDIN,
    co.EMPLOYEE_COUNT_MAX,
    COUNT(c.RBID_PER) AS contact_count
FROM RELEASES.RELEASE.ORG_LATEST co
JOIN RELEASES.RELEASE.PER_LATEST c ON c.RBID_ORG = co.RBID
WHERE co.INDUSTRY_LINKEDIN LIKE '%Software%'
  AND co.EMPLOYEE_COUNT_MAX BETWEEN 50 AND 500
GROUP BY co.RBID, co.COMPANY_NAME, co.DOMAIN, co.INDUSTRY_LINKEDIN, co.EMPLOYEE_COUNT_MAX
HAVING COUNT(c.RBID_PER) >= 1;
```

### Companies + insights (firmographics + signals)

```sql
SELECT
    co.COMPANY_NAME,
    co.DOMAIN,
    co.INDUSTRY_LINKEDIN,
    co.EMPLOYEE_COUNT_MAX,
    i.CRM_TECH_ORG,
    i.SALES_ROLE_COUNT_ORG,
    i.HAS_CIO_ORG,
    i.LAST_FUNDING_AMOUNT_ORG
FROM RELEASES.RELEASE.ORG_LATEST co
LEFT JOIN RELEASES.RELEASE.INSIGHTS_LATEST i ON co.RBID = i.RBID_ORG
WHERE co.EMPLOYEE_COUNT_MAX BETWEEN 100 AND 1000;
```


## How to calculate fill rates

Use this pattern to compute fill rates for any field or segment. Replace the sample fields with the columns you care about.

```sql
SELECT
    COUNT(*) AS total_records,
    ROUND(COUNT(DOMAIN) * 100.0 / COUNT(*), 1) AS domain_fill_pct,
    ROUND(COUNT(INDUSTRY_LINKEDIN) * 100.0 / COUNT(*), 1) AS industry_fill_pct,
    ROUND(COUNT(EMPLOYEE_COUNT_MAX) * 100.0 / COUNT(*), 1) AS employee_count_fill_pct,
    ROUND(COUNT(REVENUE_MAX) * 100.0 / COUNT(*), 1) AS revenue_fill_pct,
    ROUND(COUNT(HEADQUARTERS_COUNTRY_NAME) * 100.0 / COUNT(*), 1) AS hq_country_fill_pct
FROM RELEASES.RELEASE.ORG_LATEST;
```

## Sample queries

### Find target accounts by ICP (mid-size software in the US)

**What you’re finding:** Companies that match your ideal customer profile so you can build an account list or sync to a CRM.

**Why these fields:** `industry` and `employee_count` define ICP; `revenue_range` adds budget signal. `hq_city` and `hq_state` support territory or regional campaigns. We select only the columns you’d need for account creation or routing.

**Logic:** Filter by industry, size band, country, and revenue band. Order by `employee_count` to prioritize larger accounts within the band.

```sql
SELECT
    COMPANY_NAME,
    DOMAIN,
    INDUSTRY_LINKEDIN,
    EMPLOYEE_COUNT_MAX,
    REVENUE_RANGE,
    HEADQUARTERS_CITY,
    HEADQUARTERS_STATE_NAME
FROM RELEASES.RELEASE.ORG_LATEST
WHERE INDUSTRY_LINKEDIN LIKE '%Software%' OR INDUSTRY_LINKEDIN LIKE '%Information Technology%'
  AND EMPLOYEE_COUNT_MAX BETWEEN 50 AND 500
  AND HEADQUARTERS_COUNTRY_NAME = 'United States'
  AND REVENUE_RANGE IN ('$10-50M', '$50-100M')
ORDER BY EMPLOYEE_COUNT_MAX DESC;
```

### Check fill rates for a segment

**What you’re finding:** How complete key fields are for a subset (e.g. one industry or region) so you know what to expect when building lists.

**Why these fields:** Same as the global fill-rate query, but with a `WHERE` clause so percentages reflect only the segment you care about.

```sql
SELECT
    COUNT(*) AS total_records,
    ROUND(COUNT(DOMAIN) * 100.0 / COUNT(*), 1) AS domain_fill_pct,
    ROUND(COUNT(INDUSTRY_LINKEDIN) * 100.0 / COUNT(*), 1) AS industry_fill_pct,
    ROUND(COUNT(EMPLOYEE_COUNT_MAX) * 100.0 / COUNT(*), 1) AS employee_count_fill_pct,
    ROUND(COUNT(REVENUE_MAX) * 100.0 / COUNT(*), 1) AS revenue_fill_pct
FROM RELEASES.RELEASE.ORG_LATEST
WHERE HEADQUARTERS_COUNTRY_NAME = 'United States'
  AND INDUSTRY_LINKEDIN LIKE '%Software%';
```
