The `contacts` table contains individual person records with professional contact information and email verification data. This is the primary table for building prospect lists, outbound campaigns, and enrichment workflows. Each row is one person at one organization; if a contact holds multiple current positions, they appear in multiple rows.

## Where the data comes from

Contact records are built from professional profiles, public sources, and verified email and phone data. RevenueBase continuously verifies email deliverability using its internal email verification system and re-verifies addresses on a regular cadence. Titles, seniority, and department are normalized from raw job titles so you can filter and segment consistently.

## Contact counts by region

### Addresses (contact location)

The first set of address fields (`CITY`, `STATE_NAME`, `STATE_CODE`, `COUNTRY_NAME`, `COUNTRY_CODE`, `COUNTRY_REGION`, `CONTINENT`) describes **where the person is located** on their professional profile. The fields prefixed with `JOB_LOCATION_` describe **where the person works from** — usually the office location if they work from an office. These two address sets do not always match: someone might live in Boston, MA and work in Providence, RI. The person's location (the first set) typically has a higher fill rate, so use those fields when you search for people by location.

## Understanding verification fields

All emails in the dataset have been verified as valid by RevenueBase's email verification system. If an email address exists in the dataset, it means it has passed verification and is considered deliverable.

<Tip>For the safest outbound sends, filter on `EMAIL_LAST_VERIFIED_AT >= DATEADD(day, -30, CURRENT_DATE())` to prioritize recently verified addresses. Since all emails in the dataset are valid, you don't need to filter on `EMAIL_STATUS`.</Tip>

## Joining this table

Join `PER_LATEST` to `ORG_LATEST` on `RBID_ORG` = `RBID` when you need full firmographic or HQ address data. Join to `INSIGHTS_LATEST` on `RBID_ORG` = `RBID_ORG` when you need company-level insight or intent signals.

### Contacts + companies (full company attributes)

```sql
SELECT
    c.RBID,
    c.FIRST_NAME,
    c.LAST_NAME,
    c.EMAIL_ADDRESS,
    c.JOB_TITLE,
    co.COMPANY_NAME,
    co.INDUSTRY_LINKEDIN,
    co.EMPLOYEE_COUNT_MAX,
    co.HEADQUARTERS_CITY,
    co.HEADQUARTERS_COUNTRY_NAME
FROM RELEASES.RELEASE.PER_LATEST c
JOIN RELEASES.RELEASE.ORG_LATEST co ON c.RBID_ORG = co.RBID
WHERE co.EMPLOYEE_COUNT_MAX BETWEEN 100 AND 1000;
```

## How to calculate fill rates

Run a query that counts non-null values and divides by total rows. Use this pattern to inspect any field or segment.

```sql
SELECT
    COUNT(*) AS total_records,
    ROUND(COUNT(EMAIL_ADDRESS) * 100.0 / COUNT(*), 1) AS email_fill_pct,
    ROUND(COUNT(CELLPHONE) * 100.0 / COUNT(*), 1) AS phone_fill_pct,
    ROUND(COUNT(JOB_TITLE) * 100.0 / COUNT(*), 1) AS title_fill_pct,
    ROUND(COUNT(JOB_FUNCTION) * 100.0 / COUNT(*), 1) AS department_fill_pct
FROM RELEASES.RELEASE.PER_LATEST;
```

## Sample queries

### Build a prospect list (VP+ in engineering or sales at mid-size software companies)

**What you’re finding:** Decision-makers and influencers at software companies in a size band that fits your ICP.

**Why these fields:** All emails in the dataset are verified as valid. `EMAIL_LAST_VERIFIED_AT` helps prioritize recently verified addresses. `JOB_LEVEL` and `JOB_FUNCTION` narrow to buying roles. `LINKEDIN_INDUSTRY_ORG` and `EMPLOYEE_COUNT_MAX_ORG` (denormalized) avoid a join while filtering by ICP.

**Logic:** Restrict to verified emails, seniority in C-Suite/VP/Director, departments that typically own tooling decisions, and a single industry + employee range. Order by `EMAIL_LAST_VERIFIED_AT` so the freshest data appears first.

```sql
SELECT
    PER.FIRST_NAME,
    PER.LAST_NAME,
    PER.EMAIL_ADDRESS,
    PER.JOB_TITLE,
    PER.JOB_LEVEL,
    PER.COMPANY_NAME,
    ORG.EMPLOYEE_COUNT_MAX
FROM RELEASES.RELEASE.PER_LATEST AS PER
INNER JOIN RELEASES.RELEASE.ORG_LATEST AS ORG
ON PER.RBID_ORG = ORG.RBID
WHERE JOB_LEVEL IN ('C-Team', 'VP', 'Director')
  AND JOB_FUNCTION IN ('Engineering', 'Sales')
  AND LINKEDIN_INDUSTRY LIKE '%Software%'
  AND EMPLOYEE_COUNT_MAX BETWEEN 100 AND 1000
ORDER BY EMAIL_LAST_VERIFIED_AT DESC
LIMIT 500;
```

### Check fill rates for a segment

**What you’re finding:** How complete key fields are for a subset (e.g. one industry or country) so you can set expectations for list build size and which filters to use.

**Why these fields:** Same as the global fill-rate query, but run with a `WHERE` clause so rates reflect only the segment you care about.

```sql
SELECT
    COUNT(*) AS total_records,
    ROUND(COUNT(EMAIL_ADDRESS) * 100.0 / COUNT(*), 1) AS email_fill_pct,
    ROUND(COUNT(CELLPHONE) * 100.0 / COUNT(*), 1) AS phone_fill_pct,
    ROUND(COUNT(JOB_TITLE) * 100.0 / COUNT(*), 1) AS title_fill_pct
FROM RELEASES.RELEASE.PER_LATEST
WHERE LINKEDIN_INDUSTRY LIKE '%Software%'
  AND COUNTRY_NAME = 'United States';
```
