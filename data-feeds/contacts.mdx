### Company context (denormalized)

These fields are copied from the `companies` table for convenience. For the full set of company attributes, join to `companies` on `company_id` — or use the [People + Companies](/data-feeds/people-companies) pre-joined table.

| Field | Type | Fill rate | Description |

### Metadata

| Field | Type | Fill rate | Description |
|-------|------|-----------|-------------|
| `created_at` | TIMESTAMP | 100% | When this record was first added |
| `updated_at` | TIMESTAMP | 100% | When this record was last modified |
| `data_source` | VARCHAR | _TODO_% | Primary data source for this record |

<Warning>
  **Fill rates are approximate** and vary by segment. Contacts at larger, US-based companies tend to have higher fill rates for direct dials, seniority, and department. International and SMB records may have lower fill rates on some fields.
</Warning>

## Understanding verification fields

| `verification_status` | What it means | Safe to send? |
|-----------------------|---------------|---------------|
| `valid` | Email confirmed deliverable via SMTP verification | ✅ Yes |
| `invalid` | Email confirmed undeliverable | ❌ No |
| `catch_all` | Domain accepts all emails — specific address unverifiable | ⚠️ Proceed with caution |
| `unknown` | Verification inconclusive (server timeout, etc.) | ⚠️ Proceed with caution |
| `disposable` | Temporary / throwaway email address | ❌ No |

<Tip>
  For the safest outbound sends, filter on `verification_status = 'valid'` AND `last_verified_at >= DATEADD(day, -30, CURRENT_DATE())`. This gives you recently verified, confirmed-deliverable addresses.
</Tip>

## Example queries

### Build a prospect list

```sql
SELECT
    first_name,
    last_name,
    email,
    title,
    seniority_level,
    company_name,
    company_employee_count
FROM contacts
WHERE email_verified = TRUE
  AND seniority_level IN ('c_suite', 'vp', 'director')
  AND department IN ('engineering', 'sales')
  AND company_industry = 'Software'
  AND company_employee_count BETWEEN 100 AND 1000
ORDER BY last_verified_at DESC
LIMIT 500;
```

### Check fill rates yourself

```sql
SELECT
    COUNT(*) as total_records,
    ROUND(COUNT(email) * 100.0 / COUNT(*), 1) as email_fill_pct,
    ROUND(COUNT(CASE WHEN email_verified THEN 1 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*), 1) as verified_pct,
    ROUND(COUNT(direct_phone) * 100.0 / COUNT(*), 1) as phone_fill_pct,
    ROUND(COUNT(title) * 100.0 / COUNT(*), 1) as title_fill_pct,
    ROUND(COUNT(seniority_level) * 100.0 / COUNT(*), 1) as seniority_fill_pct,
    ROUND(COUNT(department) * 100.0 / COUNT(*), 1) as department_fill_pct
FROM contacts;
```
