# Contacts table

The `contacts` table contains individual person records with professional contact information and email verification data. This is the primary table for building prospect lists, outbound campaigns, and enrichment workflows. Each row is one person at one organization; if a contact holds multiple current positions, they appear in multiple rows.

## Where the data comes from

Contact records are built from professional profiles, public sources, and verified email and phone data. RevenueBase continuously verifies email deliverability via SMTP checks and re-verifies addresses on a regular cadence. Titles, seniority, and department are normalized from raw job titles so you can filter and segment consistently.

## Contact counts by region

The map below shows current contact counts by country. Use it to understand coverage and plan targeting by region.

## Table stats

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Total records** | See map above; updated with each release |
| **Update frequency** | Monthly (new delivery on the 1st of each month) |
| **Primary key** | `contact_id` |
| **Main foreign key** | `company_id` → `companies.company_id` |

## Data dictionary & fill rates

Fill rate is the percentage of rows where a field is non-null. Rates vary by segment (e.g. US and larger companies often have higher fill rates for phone and seniority).

### Identifiers

| Field | Type | Fill rate | Description |
|-------|------|-----------|-------------|
| `contact_id` | VARCHAR | 100% | Unique RevenueBase identifier for this contact |
| `company_id` | VARCHAR | _TODO_% | Foreign key to `companies` table |
| `linkedin_url` | VARCHAR | _TODO_% | Personal LinkedIn profile URL |

### Name & demographics

| Field | Type | Fill rate | Description |
|-------|------|-----------|-------------|
| `first_name` | VARCHAR | _TODO_% | First name |
| `last_name` | VARCHAR | _TODO_% | Last name |
| `full_name` | VARCHAR | _TODO_% | Combined full name |
| `gender` | VARCHAR | _TODO_% | Inferred gender: `male`, `female`, `unknown` |

### Professional info

| Field | Type | Fill rate | Description |
|-------|------|-----------|-------------|
| `title` | VARCHAR | _TODO_% | Current job title |
| `seniority_level` | VARCHAR | _TODO_% | Normalized seniority: `c_suite`, `vp`, `director`, `manager`, `senior`, `entry`, `other` |
| `department` | VARCHAR | _TODO_% | Functional department: `engineering`, `sales`, `marketing`, `finance`, `hr`, `operations`, `legal`, `other` |
| `title_role` | VARCHAR | _TODO_% | Normalized role from title (e.g., `ceo`, `cto`, `vp_sales`, `sdr`) |

### Contact information

| Field | Type | Fill rate | Description |
|-------|------|-----------|-------------|
| `email` | VARCHAR | _TODO_% | Primary professional email address |
| `email_verified` | BOOLEAN | _TODO_% | Whether the email has passed verification |
| `verification_status` | VARCHAR | _TODO_% | Detailed status: `valid`, `invalid`, `catch_all`, `unknown`, `disposable` |
| `last_verified_at` | TIMESTAMP | _TODO_% | When the email was most recently verified |
| `bounce_risk` | VARCHAR | _TODO_% | Deliverability risk: `low`, `medium`, `high` |
| `direct_phone` | VARCHAR | _TODO_% | Direct dial phone number |
| `mobile_phone` | VARCHAR | _TODO_% | Mobile phone number |

### Addresses (contact location)

Contact-level address fields describe the **person’s location**, which may differ from their company’s headquarters. Use them for regional targeting, territory assignment, or compliance (e.g. not contacting certain jurisdictions).

| Field | Type | Fill rate | Description |
|-------|------|-----------|-------------|
| `location_city` | VARCHAR | _TODO_% | Contact’s city |
| `location_state` | VARCHAR | _TODO_% | Contact’s state or province |
| `location_country` | VARCHAR | _TODO_% | Contact’s country (ISO 2-letter code) |

<Info>For **company** headquarters address (street, city, state, country), use the `companies` table or the denormalized company context fields on this table. Contact location is inferred from profile and may be less complete than company HQ.</Info>

### Company context (denormalized)

These fields are copied from the `companies` table for convenience. For the full set of company attributes, join to `companies` on `company_id` — or use the [People + Companies](/data-feeds/people-companies) pre-joined table.

| Field | Type | Fill rate | Description |
|-------|------|-----------|-------------|
| `company_name` | VARCHAR | _TODO_% | Company name (from `companies` table) |
| `company_domain` | VARCHAR | _TODO_% | Company primary domain |
| `company_industry` | VARCHAR | _TODO_% | Company industry |
| `company_employee_count` | INTEGER | _TODO_% | Company employee count |

### Metadata

| Field | Type | Fill rate | Description |
|-------|------|-----------|-------------|
| `created_at` | TIMESTAMP | 100% | When this record was first added |
| `updated_at` | TIMESTAMP | 100% | When this record was last modified |
| `data_source` | VARCHAR | _TODO_% | Primary data source for this record |

<Warning>**Fill rates are approximate** and vary by segment. Contacts at larger, US-based companies tend to have higher fill rates for direct dials, seniority, and department. International and SMB records may have lower fill rates on some fields.</Warning>

## Understanding verification fields

| `verification_status` | What it means | Safe to send? |
|-----------------------|---------------|---------------|
| `valid` | Email confirmed deliverable via SMTP verification | ✅ Yes |
| `invalid` | Email confirmed undeliverable | ❌ No |
| `catch_all` | Domain accepts all emails — specific address unverifiable | ⚠️ Proceed with caution |
| `unknown` | Verification inconclusive (server timeout, etc.) | ⚠️ Proceed with caution |
| `disposable` | Temporary / throwaway email address | ❌ No |

<Tip>For the safest outbound sends, filter on `verification_status = 'valid'` AND `last_verified_at >= DATEADD(day, -30, CURRENT_DATE())`. This gives you recently verified, confirmed-deliverable addresses.</Tip>

## Joining this table

Join `contacts` to **companies** on `company_id` when you need full firmographic or HQ address data. Join to **insights** on `contact_id` when you need enrichment or intent signals per contact.

### Contacts + companies (full company attributes)

```sql
SELECT
    c.contact_id,
    c.first_name,
    c.last_name,
    c.email,
    c.title,
    co.company_name,
    co.industry,
    co.employee_count,
    co.hq_city,
    co.hq_country
FROM contacts c
JOIN companies co ON c.company_id = co.company_id
WHERE c.email_verified = TRUE
  AND co.employee_count BETWEEN 100 AND 1000;
```

### Contacts + insights (contact-level signals)

```sql
SELECT
    c.contact_id,
    c.first_name,
    c.last_name,
    c.email,
    i.insight_type,
    i.observed_at
FROM contacts c
LEFT JOIN insights i ON c.contact_id = i.contact_id
WHERE c.company_id = 'YOUR_TARGET_COMPANY_ID';
```

<Note>Insights can be company-level or contact-level. When `contact_id` is not null, the insight applies to that contact; otherwise it applies to the company. Filter or join accordingly.</Note>

## How to calculate fill rates

Run a query that counts non-null values and divides by total rows. Use this pattern to inspect any field or segment.

```sql
SELECT
    COUNT(*) AS total_records,
    ROUND(COUNT(email) * 100.0 / COUNT(*), 1) AS email_fill_pct,
    ROUND(COUNT(CASE WHEN email_verified THEN 1 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*), 1) AS verified_pct,
    ROUND(COUNT(direct_phone) * 100.0 / COUNT(*), 1) AS phone_fill_pct,
    ROUND(COUNT(title) * 100.0 / COUNT(*), 1) AS title_fill_pct,
    ROUND(COUNT(seniority_level) * 100.0 / COUNT(*), 1) AS seniority_fill_pct,
    ROUND(COUNT(department) * 100.0 / COUNT(*), 1) AS department_fill_pct
FROM contacts;
```

## Sample queries

### Build a prospect list (VP+ in engineering or sales at mid-size software companies)

**What you’re finding:** Decision-makers and influencers at software companies in a size band that fits your ICP.

**Why these fields:** `email_verified` and `verification_status` reduce bounces. `seniority_level` and `department` narrow to buying roles. `company_industry` and `company_employee_count` (denormalized) avoid a join while filtering by ICP. `last_verified_at` prioritizes recently verified emails.

**Logic:** Restrict to verified emails, seniority in c_suite/vp/director, departments that typically own tooling decisions, and a single industry + employee range. Order by `last_verified_at` so the freshest data appears first.

```sql
SELECT
    first_name,
    last_name,
    email,
    title,
    seniority_level,
    company_name,
    company_employee_count
FROM contacts
WHERE email_verified = TRUE
  AND seniority_level IN ('c_suite', 'vp', 'director')
  AND department IN ('engineering', 'sales')
  AND company_industry = 'Software'
  AND company_employee_count BETWEEN 100 AND 1000
ORDER BY last_verified_at DESC
LIMIT 500;
```

### Check fill rates for a segment

**What you’re finding:** How complete key fields are for a subset (e.g. one industry or country) so you can set expectations for list build size and which filters to use.

**Why these fields:** Same as the global fill-rate query, but run with a `WHERE` clause so rates reflect only the segment you care about.

```sql
SELECT
    COUNT(*) AS total_records,
    ROUND(COUNT(email) * 100.0 / COUNT(*), 1) AS email_fill_pct,
    ROUND(COUNT(direct_phone) * 100.0 / COUNT(*), 1) AS phone_fill_pct,
    ROUND(COUNT(title) * 100.0 / COUNT(*), 1) AS title_fill_pct
FROM contacts
WHERE company_industry = 'Software'
  AND location_country = 'US';
```
