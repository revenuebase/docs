## Contacts

The **Contacts** table holds people records — individuals you can link to companies. Each row is one contact with a unique identifier, contact details, and a foreign key to the Companies table.

### What it is

Contacts represent people (e.g., decision-makers, leads). Each row typically links to one company via `company_id`. Use this table for contact-level analytics, enrichment, or joining to company attributes.

### What's in it

| Column      | Type     | Description                    |
| ----------- | -------- | ------------------------------ |
| id          | bigint   | Unique primary key.            |
| company_id  | bigint   | Foreign key to Companies.      |
| email       | string   | Email address.                 |
| created_at  | timestamp| When the record was created.   |
| updated_at  | timestamp| Last update time (UTC).        |

Add or replace columns to match your actual schema. Use the [Data dictionary](/data-feeds/data-dictionary) for full field definitions.

### How to use it

- **Filtering** — Use `WHERE` on id, company_id, or date columns as needed.
- **Joining** — Join to [Companies](/data-feeds/companies) on `contacts.company_id = companies.id`. See [Joining tables](/data-feeds/joining-tables).

### Example query

```sql
SELECT c.id, c.email, co.name AS company_name
FROM contacts c
JOIN companies co ON co.id = c.company_id
WHERE c.updated_at >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '7 days'
LIMIT 100;
```

Adjust table and column names to your real schema.
