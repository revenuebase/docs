This page walks you through connecting to RevenueBase data feeds and running your first queries.

## Accessing the data

You can access Dynamic Data Feeds in several ways:

- **SQL client** — Connect with a JDBC- or ODBC-compatible client (e.g., DBeaver, Tableau, or your preferred SQL tool) using the host, port, database, and credentials from the dashboard.
- **BI and analytics tools** — Many BI platforms can connect directly to the feed; use the connection details from **Settings** → **Data Feeds** in the dashboard.
- **Applications** — Use the same connection details from your application or ETL pipeline to query tables programmatically.

Access is controlled by the feed credentials provided in the dashboard. Keep these credentials secure and do not share them or commit them to version control.

### Prerequisites

- A RevenueBase account with Data Feeds enabled.
- Connection details from the dashboard (**Settings** → **Data Feeds**).
- A SQL client or tool that supports your connection type (e.g., JDBC, ODBC, or a BI tool).

### Step 1: Get connection details

From the dashboard you will see:

- **Host** — Feed server hostname.
- **Port** — Usually 443 for TLS.
- **Database** — Your assigned database name.
- **Username** and **Password** — Feed-specific credentials (separate from your API key).

<Note>
Feed credentials are different from your API key. Use the feed username and password only for data feed connections.
</Note>

### Step 2: Configure your client

Use the host, port, database, and credentials in your client. Example connection string pattern:

```
jdbc:postgresql://feed.revenuebase.ai:443/your_database?user=feed_user&password=***
```

Exact format depends on your driver or tool. Refer to your client’s documentation for SSL/TLS options.

### Step 3: Run a test query

After connecting, list tables or run a simple query:

```sql
-- List tables (syntax may vary by engine)
SELECT * FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema = 'public';

-- Sample query (adjust table name to one you have access to)
SELECT * FROM companies LIMIT 5;
```

### Step 4: Explore the schema

Use the table pages ([Contacts](/data-feeds/contacts), [Companies](/data-feeds/companies), [Insights](/data-feeds/insights), [Historical experience](/data-feeds/historical-experience)) and [Tables & Schema](/data-feeds/tables-schema) to see available tables and columns. Then use [Joining tables](/data-feeds/joining-tables) to combine tables correctly.

### Troubleshooting

- **Connection refused** — Check host, port, and firewall; ensure you use TLS where required.
- **Authentication failed** — Confirm you are using the feed username and password, not the API key.
- **Table or column not found** — Verify table names and schemas; they may be case-sensitive.
