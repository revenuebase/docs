## Getting started with feeds

This page walks you through connecting to RevenueBase data feeds and running your first queries.

### Prerequisites

- A RevenueBase account with Data Feeds enabled.
- Connection details from the dashboard (**Settings** → **Data Feeds**).
- A SQL client or tool that supports your connection type (e.g., JDBC, ODBC, or a BI tool).

### Step 1: Get connection details

From the dashboard you will see:

- **Host** — Feed server hostname.
- **Port** — Usually 443 for TLS.
- **Database** — Your assigned database name.
- **Username** and **Password** — Feed-specific credentials (separate from your API key).

<Note>
Feed credentials are different from your API key. Use the feed username and password only for data feed connections.
</Note>

### Step 2: Configure your client

Use the host, port, database, and credentials in your client. Example connection string pattern:

```
jdbc:postgresql://feed.revenuebase.ai:443/your_database?user=feed_user&password=***
```

Exact format depends on your driver or tool. Refer to your client’s documentation for SSL/TLS options.

### Step 3: Run a test query

After connecting, list tables or run a simple query:

```sql
-- List tables (syntax may vary by engine)
SELECT * FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema = 'public';

-- Sample query (adjust table name to one you have access to)
SELECT * FROM companies LIMIT 5;
```

### Step 4: Explore the schema

Use the [Data dictionary](/data-feeds/data-dictionary) and [Tables & Schema](/data-feeds/tables-schema) to see available tables and columns. Then use [Joining tables](/data-feeds/joining-tables) to combine tables correctly.

### Troubleshooting

- **Connection refused** — Check host, port, and firewall; ensure you use TLS where required.
- **Authentication failed** — Confirm you are using the feed username and password, not the API key.
- **Table or column not found** — Verify table names and schemas; they may be case-sensitive.
