## Dynamic Data Feeds overview

RevenueBase Dynamic Data Feeds give you access to bulk datasets you can load into your warehouse or query in Snowflake. The feeds are updated and pushed **monthly**, usually on the **1st of the month** (or the 2nd if the 1st falls on a weekend or holiday). You’ll receive an **email alert** when the feed is updated.

### Data feeds we offer

Our feeds include:

- **Companies** — Organization records and firmographics.
- **Contacts** — People linked to companies, with verification summaries.
- **Insights** — Derived insight data (scores, signals).
- **Historical Experience** — Job and experience history for contacts.

Additional feeds may be available depending on your agreement. Each feed has its own tables or subdirectories; see [Getting started with feeds](/data-feeds/getting-started-feeds) and [Accessing your data](/data-feeds/accessing-your-data) for how to connect.

### Key concepts

- **Tables** — Each feed is organized into tables (e.g., Companies, Contacts). See the Tables & Schema section in this doc set for the full list and column definitions.
- **Joins** — Tables share common keys so you can join them. See [Joining Tables](/data-feeds/joining-overview) for relationships and best practices.
- **Updates** — Feeds are refreshed monthly; you get an email when a new release is available.
