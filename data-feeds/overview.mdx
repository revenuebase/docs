RevenueBase delivers structured B2B data through **Dynamic Data Feeds** — continuously updated datasets on a monthly cadence. Data is available in our **S3 bucket** (we grant your AWS account access), or we share it through **Snowflake Data Sharing** to your Snowflake account. This guide walks you through onboarding, accessing your data, and understanding the tables available in your feed.

---

## Get access to your data feed

To get started, provide a few details based on your chosen delivery method. After you provide this information, RevenueBase will provision access and deliver your first dataset — typically within 1–2 business days.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="AWS S3">
    ### Provide your AWS details and get credentials

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Provide your AWS Account ID">
        Share your **12-digit AWS Account ID** with your RevenueBase onboarding contact. This is required so we can grant your account access to our S3 bucket.

        <Tip>You can find your AWS Account ID in the top-right dropdown of the AWS Console, or by running `aws sts get-caller-identity` in the AWS CLI.</Tip>
      </Step>
      <Step title="Receive your access credentials">
        Once provisioned, we'll share your bucket details including:

        - **S3 bucket alias** (or ARN-based access point)
        - **AWS region** for the bucket (by default `eu-north-1`)

        <Warning>Store your credentials securely. Do not commit them to version control or share them over unencrypted channels.</Warning>
      </Step>
      <Step title="Verify access">
        Test your connection using the AWS CLI:

        ```bash
        aws s3 ls s3://<your-bucket-alias>/<delivery_date>/  \
          --request-payer requester  \
          --region <target-bucket-region>
        ```

        You can also access via ARN:

        ```bash
        aws s3 ls s3://arn:aws:s3:<region>:<account-id>:accesspoint/<access-point-name>/<delivery_date>/  \
          --request-payer requester  \
          --region <target-bucket-region>
        ```

        <Info>Use the **AWS CLI** — not the AWS Console web UI — to access RevenueBase buckets. The Console does not support `--request-payer` and will return access errors.</Info>
      </Step>
    </Steps>

    ### Find your data in the bucket

    RevenueBase supports dynamic feeds in three formats: **CSV**, **JSON**, and **Parquet**. When you get access to the data in S3, you get access to all three formats. For more on Parquet, see the <a href="https://parquet.apache.org/docs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">official Parquet documentation</a>. Your data lives in date-stamped folders within the S3 bucket. The path structure is:

    ```
    <delivery_date>/<dataset_name>/<file_format>/
    ```

    | Path segment      | Description                                                                 |
    | ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `delivery_date`   | Date of delivery in `YYYYMMDD` format (e.g., `20260201`)                    |
    | `dataset_name`    | The dataset included in your subscription (e.g., `per`, `org`, or a pre-joined dataset) |
    | `file_format`     | One of `json`, `csv`, or `parquet`                                           |

    Each monthly delivery creates a **new folder**. Previous deliveries remain accessible at their original paths and are never overwritten.

    <Note>Data is split across multiple files within each delivery folder. This is by design — it enables parallel processing and significantly improves import performance for large datasets.</Note>

    ### Provide your Snowflake details and accept the share

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Provide your Snowflake account locator">
        Share your **Snowflake Account Locator** with your RevenueBase onboarding contact. This is the unique identifier for your Snowflake account.

        <Tip>Find your account locator and other account details in the Snowflake UI under **Admin → Accounts**, or in your Snowflake URL (e.g., `https://<account_locator>.snowflakecomputing.com`). For the full guide on where to get account identifier information, see <a href="https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/admin-account-identifier" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Snowflake's account identifier documentation</a>.</Tip>
      </Step>
      <Step title="Confirm your Snowflake region">
        Let us know which **Snowflake region** your account is hosted in (e.g., `us-east-1`, `eu-west-1`). The share must be created in the same region as your account.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Share your Snowflake account URL">
        Provide the full URL your organization uses to access Snowflake. This helps us ensure the share is routed correctly. For where to find your account identifier and URL, see <a href="https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/admin-account-identifier" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Snowflake's account identifier documentation</a>.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Accept the share via Data Sharing">
        Once we've added you to the share, you'll see it in your Snowflake account. To access it:

        1. Open **Data Sharing** in the left panel of the Snowflake UI
        2. Find the RevenueBase incoming share (e.g., `RELEASES_EXT_SHARE` or `RELEASES_RAW_SHARE`)
        3. Click **Get** or **Get Data** to add the shared database to your account (button at top right coner)

        This creates a new database called **RELEASES** in your Snowflake account containing the shared tables.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Query your data">
        Once the share is accepted, you can query the tables directly:

        ```sql
        SELECT *
        FROM RELEASES.RELEASE.PER_LATEST
        LIMIT 100;
        ```

        {/* TODO: Add screenshot of Snowflake worksheet with sample query results */}
      </Step>
    </Steps>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Info>
  **Azure and GCP delivery** — Access and delivery through other clouds (Google Cloud Storage and Azure Blob Storage) is available. File format options (CSV, JSON, Parquet) and delivery cadence are the same as S3. Please contact your account manager or **support@revenuebase.ai** for details.
</Info>

## Data updates & refresh schedule

RevenueBase data is updated on a **monthly** basis.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Release schedule" icon="calendar">
    New data drops target the **1st of each month**. Depending on weekends, the actual date may shift by ±2–3 days.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Email notifications" icon="envelope">
    We send an **email notification** to your team when new data has been posted and is ready for consumption.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Profile verification" icon="badge-check">
    95% of profiles are re-verified every **90 days**. "Re-verified" means the source profile was accessible and we confirmed or updated at least the core profile information — name, current title, company association, and location. Check the `updated_at` field for the most recent verification date on any record. See [Data Freshness & Quality](/data-feeds/data-freshness-quality) for details on what happens when profiles can't be reached.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Email verification" icon="at">
    All email addresses are re-verified every **60 days**. See the `email_last_verified_at` field. A recently validated email is one of the strongest indicators that a record is current — prioritize records with recent `email_last_verified_at` dates when building high-confidence segments for outbound or enrichment.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Tip>For S3 deliveries, each update creates a new date-stamped folder. Previous deliveries remain accessible and are never overwritten. Bucket names and credentials remain the same across all deliveries.</Tip>

For a deeper look at why some records may be older than expected and how to assess data quality programmatically, see [Data Freshness & Quality](/data-feeds/data-freshness-quality).

## Available tables

Your RevenueBase subscription includes access to the following tables, depending on your plan. In Snowflake, these appear under the `RELEASES` database. For S3 deliveries, each table corresponds to a dataset folder in your bucket. For full schema and field reference, see [Contacts](/data-feeds/contacts), [Companies](/data-feeds/companies), [Insights](/data-feeds/insights), and [Historical experience](/data-feeds/historical-experience).

### [Person table](/data-feeds/contacts) (`per`)

The core contact-level table. Each row represents a person at a specific organization.

<Info>If someone holds multiple current positions, they will have **multiple rows** in the person table — each with a unique `RBID_PAO` but sharing the same `RBID_PER`.</Info>

<Note>`RBID_ORG` and `RBID_PAO` may be missing if the person's LinkedIn profile does not link to a company page. This occurs because the company name field on LinkedIn is free text — people can enter anything and may skip linking to an existing company page.</Note>

**Snowflake path:** `RELEASES.RELEASE.PER_LATEST`

**S3 path:** `<delivery_date>/per/<format>/`

See [Contacts](/data-feeds/contacts) for the full field reference.

{/* TODO: Add screenshot of sample person table data in Snowflake or a data preview */}

### [Organization table](/data-feeds/companies) (`org`)

Company-level data including firmographics, technographics, and company metadata.

**Snowflake path:** `RELEASES.RELEASE.ORG_LATEST`

**S3 path:** `<delivery_date>/org/<format>/`

See [Companies](/data-feeds/companies) for the full field reference.

### [Insights table](/data-feeds/insights)

Aggregated analytics and derived metrics across people and organizations.

**Snowflake path:** `RELEASES.RELEASE.INSIGHTS_LATEST`

See [Insights](/data-feeds/insights) for the full field reference.

### Raw feed

The unprocessed, full-fidelity data feed for advanced use cases and custom pipelines.

**Snowflake path:** `RELEASES.CUSTOM.RAW_FEED_PER_LATEST`

### Pre-joined tables

Pre-joined tables combine multiple core tables so you can query people, companies, and optionally insights in a single view without writing joins.
Pre-joined tables is an option your could choose for you subscription instead of separate tables of people/company/insights delivered to you.
That way to data delivery less flexible, but easy to adopt and use.

#### People and companies

Pre-joined table containing people and company data in one view.

**Snowflake path:** `RELEASES.RELEASE.VELOCITY_BASE_UNLIMITED_LATEST`

**S3 path:** `<delivery_date>/velocity_base_unlimited/<format>/`

#### People, companies, and insights

Pre-joined table containing people, company, and insight data in one view.

**Snowflake path:** `RELEASES.RELEASE.VELOCITY_ENHANCED_UNLIMITED_LATEST`

**S3 path:** `<delivery_date>/velocity_enhanced_unlimited/<format>/`
