RevenueBase delivers structured B2B data directly to your infrastructure through **Dynamic Data Feeds** — continuously updated datasets pushed to your AWS S3 bucket or Snowflake account on a monthly cadence. This guide walks you through onboarding, accessing your data, and understanding the tables available in your feed.

---

## Onboarding

To get started, we need a few details from your team depending on your chosen delivery method. Once we have this information, we'll provision access and deliver your first dataset — typically within 1–2 business days.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="AWS S3">
    ### What we need from you

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Provide your AWS Account ID">
        Share your **12-digit AWS Account ID** with your RevenueBase onboarding contact. This is required so we can grant your account access to the shared S3 bucket.

        <Tip>You can find your AWS Account ID in the top-right dropdown of the AWS Console, or by running `aws sts get-caller-identity` in the AWS CLI.</Tip>
      </Step>
      <Step title="Confirm your preferred data format">
        Let us know which file format you'd like for your deliveries:

        - **CSV** — Best for spreadsheet tools, SQL imports, and lightweight pipelines
        - **JSON** — Best for programmatic ingestion and nested data structures
        - **Parquet** — Best for high-performance analytics and columnar query engines
      </Step>
      <Step title="Receive your access credentials">
        Once provisioned, we'll share your bucket details including:

        - **S3 bucket alias** (or ARN-based access point)
        - **AWS region** for the bucket
        - **Access credentials** (AWS Key / Secret)

        <Warning>Store your credentials securely. Do not commit them to version control or share them over unencrypted channels.</Warning>
      </Step>
      <Step title="Verify access">
        Test your connection using the AWS CLI:

        ```bash
        aws s3 ls s3://<your-bucket-alias>/<delivery_date>/  \
          --request-payer requester  \
          --region <your-region>
        ```

        You can also access via ARN:

        ```bash
        aws s3 ls s3://arn:aws:s3:<region>:<account-id>:accesspoint/<access-point-name>/<delivery_date>/  \
          --request-payer requester  \
          --region <your-region>
        ```

        <Info>Use the **AWS CLI** — not the AWS Console web UI — to access RevenueBase buckets. The Console does not support `--request-payer` and will return access errors.</Info>
      </Step>
    </Steps>

    ### Where to find your data

    Your data lives in date-stamped folders within the S3 bucket. The path structure is:

    ```
    <delivery_date>/<dataset_name>/<file_format>/
    ```

    | Path segment      | Description                                                                 |
    | ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `delivery_date`   | Date of delivery in `YYYYMMDD` format (e.g., `20260201`)                    |
    | `dataset_name`    | The dataset included in your subscription (e.g., `per`, `org`, `velocity_enhanced_unlimited`) |
    | `file_format`     | One of `json`, `csv`, or `parquet`                                           |

    Each monthly delivery creates a **new folder**. Previous deliveries remain accessible at their original paths and are never overwritten.

    <Note>Data is split across multiple files within each delivery folder. This is by design — it enables parallel processing and significantly improves import performance for large datasets.</Note>

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Snowflake">
    ### What we need from you

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Provide your Snowflake account locator">
        Share your **Snowflake Account Locator** with your RevenueBase onboarding contact. This is the unique identifier for your Snowflake account.

        <Tip>Find your account locator in the Snowflake UI under **Admin → Accounts**, or in your Snowflake URL (e.g., `https://<account_locator>.snowflakecomputing.com`).</Tip>
      </Step>
      <Step title="Confirm your Snowflake region">
        Let us know which **Snowflake region** your account is hosted in (e.g., `us-east-1`, `eu-west-1`). The share must be created in the same region as your account.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Share your Snowflake account URL">
        Provide the full URL your organization uses to access Snowflake. This helps us ensure the share is routed correctly.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Accept the private share">
        Once we've provisioned the share, you'll see it in your Snowflake account. To access it:

        1. Navigate to **Data Sharing → Private Sharing** in the left panel of the Snowflake UI
        2. Click on the incoming share tabs (e.g., `RELEASES_EXT_SHARE` or `RELEASES_RAW_SHARE`)
        3. Click **Get Data** to add the shared database to your account

        This creates a new database called **RELEASES** in your Snowflake account containing the shared tables.

        {/* TODO: Add screenshot of Snowflake Private Sharing UI showing incoming shares */}
      </Step>
      <Step title="Query your data">
        Once the share is accepted, you can query the tables directly:

        ```sql
        SELECT *
        FROM RELEASES.RELEASE.PER_LATEST
        LIMIT 100;
        ```

        {/* TODO: Add screenshot of Snowflake worksheet with sample query results */}
      </Step>
    </Steps>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Data updates & refresh schedule

RevenueBase data is updated on a **monthly** basis.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Release schedule" icon="calendar">
    New data drops target the **1st of each month**. Depending on weekends, the actual date may shift by ±2–3 days.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Email notifications" icon="envelope">
    We send an **email notification** to your team when new data has been posted and is ready for consumption.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Profile verification" icon="badge-check">
    95% of profiles are re-verified every **90 days**. Check the `updated_at` field for the most recent verification date on any record.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Email verification" icon="at">
    All email addresses are re-verified every **60 days**. See the `email_last_verified_at` field. A valid email is a strong signal that the work experience is current.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Tip>For S3 deliveries, each update creates a new date-stamped folder. Previous deliveries remain accessible and are never overwritten. Bucket names and credentials remain the same across all deliveries.</Tip>

---

## Available tables

Your RevenueBase subscription includes access to the following tables, depending on your plan. In Snowflake, these appear under the `RELEASES` database. For S3 deliveries, each table corresponds to a dataset folder in your bucket.

### Person table (`per`)

The core contact-level table. Each row represents a person at a specific organization.

| Field | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |
| `RBID_PER` | Unique person identifier. Follows the person across job changes. |
| `RBID_ORG` | Unique organization identifier. |
| `RBID_PAO` | Unique person-at-organization identifier (`RBID_PER` + `RBID_ORG`). Changes when a person moves to a new company. |
| `updated_at` | Date the profile was last verified by RevenueBase. |
| `email_last_verified_at` | Date the email address was last verified. |
| `country_code_per` | ISO country code for the person's location (e.g., `GB`, `US`). |

<Info>If someone holds multiple current positions, they will have **multiple rows** in the person table — each with a unique `RBID_PAO` but sharing the same `RBID_PER`.</Info>

<Note>`RBID_ORG` and `RBID_PAO` may be missing if the person's LinkedIn profile does not link to a company page. This occurs because the company name field on LinkedIn is free text — people can enter anything and may skip linking to an existing company page.</Note>

**Snowflake path:** `RELEASES.RELEASE.PER_LATEST`

**S3 path:** `<delivery_date>/per/<format>/`

{/* TODO: Add screenshot of sample person table data in Snowflake or a data preview */}

### Organization table (`org`)

Company-level data including firmographics, technographics, and company metadata.

| Field | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |
| `RBID_ORG` | Unique organization identifier. Joins to the person table. |
| `headquarters_country_name_org` | Country where the company is headquartered (e.g., `United Kingdom`). |
| `linkedin_url_org` | LinkedIn company page URL. |
| `claimed_page` | Whether the LinkedIn company page appears to be claimed/active. |

<Note>Claimed page detection checks for custom logos, website addresses, company size, and descriptions. This method is not 100% accurate — some well-populated pages may still appear unclaimed. We're actively improving this feature.</Note>

**Snowflake path:** `RELEASES.RELEASE.ORG_LATEST`

**S3 path:** `<delivery_date>/org/<format>/`

### Insights table

Aggregated analytics and derived metrics across people and organizations.

**Snowflake path:** `RELEASES.RELEASE.INSIGHTS_LATEST`

### Raw feed

The unprocessed, full-fidelity data feed for advanced use cases and custom pipelines.

**Snowflake path:** `RELEASES.CUSTOM.RAW_FEED_PER_LATEST`

### Velocity tables

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Velocity Base Unlimited">
    The base unlimited dataset covering all available records.

    **Snowflake path:** `RELEASES.RELEASE.VELOCITY_BASE_UNLIMITED_LATEST`

    **S3 path:** `<delivery_date>/velocity_base_unlimited/<format>/`
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Velocity Enhanced Unlimited">
    The enhanced unlimited dataset with additional insight fields and deeper coverage.

    **Snowflake path:** `RELEASES.RELEASE.VELOCITY_ENHANCED_UNLIMITED_LATEST`

    **S3 path:** `<delivery_date>/velocity_enhanced_unlimited/<format>/`
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="AWS S3: InvalidAccessPointAlias error">
    This error typically occurs when using the **AWS Console** instead of the **AWS CLI**, or when the region is misconfigured.

    - Ensure you're using the AWS CLI (not the Console web UI)
    - Confirm you're targeting the correct region in your CLI command
    - Verify your AWS account has been linked to the RevenueBase bucket

    If the issue persists, contact your RevenueBase onboarding representative.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="AWS S3: Access Denied or bucket not found">
    - Double-check that you're including `--request-payer requester` in your CLI command
    - Verify your AWS credentials are configured correctly (`aws configure`)
    - Ensure the bucket alias or ARN is copied exactly as provided — typos in the access point name are common
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Snowflake: Share not visible">
    - Confirm your Snowflake account locator and region match what was provided to RevenueBase during onboarding
    - Check **Data Sharing → Private Sharing** (not Marketplace)
    - If you recently onboarded, allow up to 24 hours for the share to propagate
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Missing RBID_ORG or RBID_PAO fields">
    These fields may be null when a person's LinkedIn profile doesn't link to a company page. The company name on LinkedIn is free text, so some profiles will not have a resolvable organization ID. A valid company email is the strongest indicator that the person-organization association is accurate.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Logo URLs returning 403 errors">
    LinkedIn periodically rotates logo URLs. Updated URLs are included in each monthly data refresh. For reliable access, we recommend building a **logo cache** on your end and populating it incrementally with each delivery.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
