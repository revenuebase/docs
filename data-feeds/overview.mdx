## Data Feeds overview

RevenueBase data feeds give you access to bulk and streaming datasets you can query with SQL or load into your own warehouse. Use feeds for analytics, enrichment, and reporting.

### What are data feeds?

Data feeds are structured datasets exposed over a secure connection. You connect with a supported client (e.g., JDBC, ODBC, or our recommended tools), then query tables using standard SQL. Data is updated on a schedule or in near real time depending on the feed.

### Key concepts

- **Tables** — Each feed is organized into tables (e.g., companies, contacts). See [Tables & Schema](/data-feeds/tables-schema) for the full list.
- **Schema** — Column names, types, and descriptions are documented in the [Data dictionary](/data-feeds/data-dictionary) and per-table pages.
- **Joins** — Tables share common keys so you can join them. See [Joining tables](/data-feeds/joining-tables) for relationships and best practices.

### Getting access

1. Ensure your plan includes Data Feeds.
2. In the dashboard, open **Settings** → **Data Feeds** to get connection details and credentials.
3. Follow [Getting started with feeds](/data-feeds/getting-started-feeds) to connect and run your first query.
