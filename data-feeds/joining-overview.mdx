RevenueBase data is organized into separate tables that link together through shared keys. This page explains how the tables relate and how to join them correctly.

## Entity relationship overview

{/* TODO: If you have an ER diagram, add it as an image here */}
{/* <Frame><img src="/images/er-diagram.png" alt="Entity relationship diagram" /></Frame> */}

Here's how the main tables connect:

```
companies (1) ──── (many) contacts
    │                        │
    │                        │
    └──── (many) emails ─────┘
```

## Join keys reference

{/* TODO: Fill in with your actual join keys */}

| From table | To table | Join key | Join type | Notes |
|-----------|----------|----------|-----------|-------|
| `contacts` | `companies` | `contacts.company_id = companies.company_id` | LEFT JOIN | Not all contacts have a company |
| `contacts` | `emails` | `contacts.contact_id = emails.contact_id` | LEFT JOIN | A contact may have multiple emails |
| `companies` | `emails` | `companies.company_id = emails.company_id` | LEFT JOIN | All emails associated with a company |

## Common join patterns

### Contacts with company info

The most common join — enriching contacts with their company's firmographic data:

```sql
SELECT
    c.FIRST_NAME,
    c.LAST_NAME,
    c.EMAIL_ADDRESS,
    c.JOB_TITLE,
    co.COMPANY_NAME,
    co.INDUSTRY_LINKEDIN,
    co.EMPLOYEE_COUNT_MAX,
    co.LOCATION_CITY,
    co.LOCATION_STATE_NAME
FROM RELEASES.RELEASE.PER_LATEST c
LEFT JOIN RELEASES.RELEASE.ORG_LATEST co ON c.RBID_ORG = co.RBID
WHERE c.EMAIL_ADDRESS IS NOT NULL;
```

{/* TODO: Update column names to match your schema */}

<Note>
  Use `LEFT JOIN` (not `INNER JOIN`) if you want to include contacts that don't have a company record. Use `INNER JOIN` if you only want contacts with a known company.
</Note>

### Contacts with their primary email verification details

```sql
SELECT
    c.FIRST_NAME,
    c.LAST_NAME,
    c.EMAIL_ADDRESS,
    c.EMAIL_LAST_VERIFIED_AT
FROM RELEASES.RELEASE.PER_LATEST c
WHERE c.EMAIL_ADDRESS IS NOT NULL;
```

{/* TODO: Update column names */}

### Full join: contacts + companies + emails

```sql
SELECT
    c.FIRST_NAME,
    c.LAST_NAME,
    c.JOB_TITLE,
    co.COMPANY_NAME,
    co.INDUSTRY_LINKEDIN,
    co.EMPLOYEE_COUNT_MAX,
    c.EMAIL_ADDRESS,
    c.EMAIL_STATUS,
    c.EMAIL_LAST_VERIFIED_AT
FROM RELEASES.RELEASE.PER_LATEST c
LEFT JOIN RELEASES.RELEASE.ORG_LATEST co ON c.RBID_ORG = co.RBID
WHERE c.EMAIL_ADDRESS IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY c.EMAIL_LAST_VERIFIED_AT DESC;
```

## Gotchas and tips

{/* TODO: Fill these in based on what you've seen customers struggle with */}

<Accordion title="Duplicate rows from one-to-many joins">
  If a contact has multiple email records, joining `contacts` to `emails` will produce one row per email. To avoid duplicates, filter on `e.is_primary = TRUE` or use a subquery to pick one email per contact.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="NULL company_id">
  Not every contact has a linked company. If you use `INNER JOIN` on `companies`, you'll silently drop those contacts. Use `LEFT JOIN` unless you specifically want to exclude unmatched contacts.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Performance on large joins">
  When joining across large tables, always include filter conditions (`WHERE` clauses) to reduce the working set before the join. Filtering on `EMAIL_LAST_VERIFIED_AT` or `INDUSTRY_LINKEDIN` early will significantly speed up queries.

## Joining with your own data

You can also join RevenueBase tables with your own internal data in Snowflake. The most common approach is matching on `domain`:

```sql
-- Match your account list against RevenueBase companies by domain
SELECT
    your_accounts.account_name,
    co.COMPANY_NAME,
    co.EMPLOYEE_COUNT_MAX,
    co.INDUSTRY_LINKEDIN
FROM your_database.your_schema.accounts your_accounts
JOIN RELEASES.RELEASE.ORG_LATEST co
  ON LOWER(your_accounts.website_domain) = LOWER(co.DOMAIN);
```

{/* TODO: Update schema/database names and column names */}

<Tip>
  Always normalize domains when joining — use `LOWER()` and strip `www.` prefixes to avoid mismatches.
</Tip>
