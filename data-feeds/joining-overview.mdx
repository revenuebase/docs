## Joining tables overview

RevenueBase Dynamic Data Feeds tables are designed to be joined so you can combine people, companies, insights, and historical experience in a single query. This section explains how tables relate and how to get started.

### Why join?

- **Contacts** link to **Companies** via `company_id` — get contact and company attributes together.
- **Insights** and **Historical Experience** link to Contacts and/or Companies — add scores, signals, or job history to your analysis.

### Quick reference

- **Companies** — Primary entity table (organizations).
- **Contacts** — People; join to Companies on `contacts.company_id = companies.id`.
- **Insights** — Join on `contact_id` and/or `company_id`.
- **Historical Experience** — Join on `contact_id` (and optionally `company_id`).
