---

You can access RevenueBase Dynamic Data Feeds in two ways: **cloud object storage** (AWS S3, Azure Blob, or Google Cloud Storage) or **Snowflake** (marketplace share). You provide the required account information to RevenueBase; we then grant you access to the data you’ve licensed.

## What we need from you

### Cloud storage (S3, Azure Blob, Google Cloud)

For AWS S3, Azure Blob, or Google Cloud Storage access, we need:

- **Account ID** (or equivalent identifier for your cloud account).
- **Role ARN** (optional) — If you want to limit access to a specific IAM role (e.g., S3) or its equivalent in Azure/GCP, provide the role ARN or role details so we can grant access only to that identity.

Once we have this information, we grant your account (or role) access to the location where we publish your data.

### Snowflake

For Snowflake, we use a **marketplace share**. We need the appropriate Snowflake account information from you (e.g., account identifier, region if relevant) so we can add you to the share. Once the share is set up, you’ll have access to the database and schemas you’ve licensed.

## What you get access to

### In Snowflake

After access is granted, you’ll see the shared database and schemas in your Snowflake account. Use standard SQL to query the views and tables you’re licensed for.

| Placeholder | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| `&lt;database&gt;` | Shared database name provided to you. |
| `&lt;schema&gt;` | Schema(s) for the data products you’ve licensed. |
| Views / tables | Tables and views for Companies, Contacts, Insights, Historical Experience, and other feeds as per your agreement. |

### In cloud storage (S3, Azure, GCP)

You get access to a **directory (bucket/container path)** where RevenueBase publishes updates. Each update is published in a **subdirectory whose name includes the date** of the release. Inside, you’ll find files in **CSV, JSON, and Parquet**. Each data feed has its own subdirectory.

Example folder structure (placeholders):

```
<bucket-or-container>/
  <base-path>/
    2025-01-01/           ← date of this update
      Companies/
      Contacts/
      Insights/
      Historical_Experience/
      ...
    2025-02-01/           ← next monthly update
      Companies/
      Contacts/
      ...
```

You’ll see only the feeds you’ve licensed. The exact path and naming (e.g., `2025-01-01` vs `20250101`) will be provided when we set up your access.

<Tip>
Provide your account ID (and optional role ARN) or Snowflake account info to RevenueBase so we can grant you access to what you’ve licensed. Contact your RevenueBase representative or use the dashboard to submit the details.
