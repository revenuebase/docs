## Verification Summaries

The **revenuebase_contact_verification_summary** field gives you a human- and machine-readable summary of how and when RevenueBase verified a contact. Use it to understand data freshness and to display verification transparency to your users.

## Example field

The **revenuebase_contact_verification_summary** field might look like this:

<Card title="Verified by RevenueBase" icon="circle-check">
  **Experience** last observed on LinkedIn on September 7, 2025: Proposal Manager at Metaphase  
  **Profile:** [linkedin.com/in/jamie-gregory-28878356](https://linkedin.com/in/jamie-gregory-28878356)  
  **Email** last verified on October 15, 2025 via RevenueBase's Email Verification Tool  
  **Next verification** scheduled: November 2025

</Card>

## How to read it

Use this key to interpret each part of the summary:

| Element | Meaning |
| -------- | ------- |
| **Verified by RevenueBase** | The record was verified directly by RevenueBase systems. |
| **Experience last observed** | The last time the LinkedIn profile was publicly visible in this state. |
| **Email verified** | When the mailbox was confirmed to exist within its domain. |
| **Next verification** | When the contact is next scheduled for re-verification. |

## Observe, verify, reconfirm

RevenueBase follows a clear process for every contact:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Observe">
    We observe publicly available professional information such as LinkedIn profiles.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify">
    We verify email deliverability and domain integrity using our proprietary system.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Reconfirm">
    We recheck every contact regularly: public LinkedIn profiles every 90 days, email every 60 days.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## What we know, and what can change

Our Verification Summary shows exactly what RevenueBase observed and when. Profiles and domains can change after verification—sometimes even retroactively. While no dataset can be 100% accurate, RevenueBase provides the most transparent view possible into each record's verification history.

## Continuous updates

RevenueBase continuously updates its dataset and reissues verification summaries in every release, so the field always reflects the latest observed and verified information:

| Cadence | What happens |
| -------- | -------------- |
| **Every 30 days** | Full dataset refresh. |
| **Every 60 days** | Email deliverability is re-verified. |
| **Every 90 days** | Current employer and job title re-confirmed using a trusted source such as public LinkedIn profiles. |

<Tip>
Use the **revenuebase_contact_verification_summary** field in your UI or exports so your users and AI systems can see verification dates and sources at a glance.
