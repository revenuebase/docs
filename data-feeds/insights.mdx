---

The `insights` table contains insight data and derived intelligence about companies. Use it to prioritize accounts based on buying signals, identify companies going through growth or change, and layer intent-like signals into your targeting. All insights are company-level only.

## Where the data comes from

Insights are derived from multiple sources: technographic data from website and stack detection, hiring data from job boards and career pages, funding data from press and regulatory filings, and engagement-style signals where available. Data is updated with each monthly release; recency varies by signal type.

## Counts and coverage

Insight record count depends on your subscription and which products (e.g. technographics, hiring, funding) are enabled. Not every company has insights; fill rates are highest for companies with a clear web presence and for venture-backed companies (funding). Use the fill-rate query below to see coverage for your dataset.

## Table stats

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Total records** | Varies by subscription; one row per insight event or snapshot |
| **Update frequency** | Monthly (aligned with contacts and companies release) |
| **Primary key** | `RBID_ORG` |
| **Main foreign key** | `RBID_ORG` → `org.RBID` |

## Data dictionary & fill rates

Fill rates vary significantly by insight type. Technographic data is available for companies with a detectable web/tech footprint; funding data is richest for venture-backed companies; hiring signals depend on public job postings.

## Joining this table

Join `INSIGHTS_LATEST` to `ORG_LATEST` on `RBID_ORG` = `RBID` to attach firmographics. To get insights for contacts, join `PER_LATEST` to `INSIGHTS_LATEST` on `per.RBID_ORG` = `insights.RBID_ORG`.

### Insights + companies (signals with firmographics)

```sql
SELECT
    co.COMPANY_NAME,
    co.DOMAIN,
    co.INDUSTRY_LINKEDIN,
    co.EMPLOYEE_COUNT_MAX,
    i.CRM_TECH_ORG,
    i.SALES_ROLE_COUNT_ORG,
    i.HAS_CIO_ORG,
    i.EMPLOYEE_ON_LINKEDIN_GROWTH_RATE_ORG,
    i.LAST_FUNDING_AMOUNT_ORG
FROM RELEASES.RELEASE.INSIGHTS_LATEST i
JOIN RELEASES.RELEASE.ORG_LATEST co ON i.RBID_ORG = co.RBID
WHERE co.EMPLOYEE_COUNT_MAX BETWEEN 50 AND 500;
```

### Insights + contacts + companies (company-level insights with contact context)

```sql
SELECT
    c.FIRST_NAME,
    c.LAST_NAME,
    c.EMAIL_ADDRESS,
    c.JOB_TITLE,
    co.COMPANY_NAME,
    co.DOMAIN,
    i.CRM_TECH_ORG,
    i.SALES_ROLE_COUNT_ORG
FROM RELEASES.RELEASE.PER_LATEST c
JOIN RELEASES.RELEASE.ORG_LATEST co ON c.RBID_ORG = co.RBID
JOIN RELEASES.RELEASE.INSIGHTS_LATEST i ON c.RBID_ORG = i.RBID_ORG
ORDER BY i.LAST_FUNDING_DATE_ORG DESC;
```

## How to calculate fill rates

Use this pattern to see how many records have each insight type and how complete key fields are.

```sql
SELECT
    COUNT(*) AS record_count,
    ROUND(COUNT(CRM_TECH_ORG) * 100.0 / COUNT(*), 1) AS tech_fill_pct,
    ROUND(COUNT(SALES_ROLE_COUNT_ORG) * 100.0 / COUNT(*), 1) AS hiring_fill_pct,
    ROUND(COUNT(LAST_FUNDING_AMOUNT_ORG) * 100.0 / COUNT(*), 1) AS funding_fill_pct,
    ROUND(COUNT(EMPLOYEE_ON_LINKEDIN_GROWTH_RATE_ORG) * 100.0 / COUNT(*), 1) AS growth_fill_pct
FROM RELEASES.RELEASE.INSIGHTS_LATEST;
```

## Sample queries

### Find companies showing growth signals (hiring + headcount growth)

**What you’re finding:** Companies that are growing headcount and actively hiring — strong candidates for sales or hiring tools.

**Why these fields:** `headcount_growth_6m` and `is_hiring` are the main growth signals. We join to **companies** to filter by size (`employee_count`) and to get `company_name` and `domain`. `recent_funding` and `funding_round_type` add optional context for prioritization.

**Logic:** Require meaningful headcount growth and hiring, and limit to a mid-market size band. Order by growth rate so the hottest accounts are first.

```sql
SELECT
    co.COMPANY_NAME,
    co.DOMAIN,
    co.EMPLOYEE_COUNT_MAX,
    i.EMPLOYEE_ON_LINKEDIN_GROWTH_RATE_ORG,
    i.SALES_OPEN_ROLES_COUNT_ORG,
    i.LAST_FUNDING_AMOUNT_ORG,
    i.LAST_FUNDING_TYPE_ORG
FROM RELEASES.RELEASE.INSIGHTS_LATEST i
JOIN RELEASES.RELEASE.ORG_LATEST co ON i.RBID_ORG = co.RBID
WHERE i.EMPLOYEE_ON_LINKEDIN_GROWTH_RATE_ORG > 20
  AND i.SALES_OPEN_ROLES_COUNT_ORG > 0
  AND co.EMPLOYEE_COUNT_MAX BETWEEN 50 AND 500
ORDER BY i.EMPLOYEE_ON_LINKEDIN_GROWTH_RATE_ORG DESC;
```

### Companies that recently adopted a specific technology

**What you’re finding:** Accounts that added a technology (e.g. Snowflake) in the last 6 months — good for competitive displacement or upsell plays.

**Why these fields:** `technologies_detected` (array) is filtered for the product name; `tech_added_date` restricts to recent adoption. We join to **companies** for name and domain. Array syntax in the WHERE clause depends on your warehouse (see call-out above).

**Logic:** Filter to technographic insights, require the technology to be in the detected list, and limit to the last 6 months. Order by `tech_added_date` descending so the most recent adopters appear first.

```sql
SELECT
    co.COMPANY_NAME,
    co.DOMAIN,
    i.CRM_TECH_ORG,
    i.DEVELOPMENT_TECH_ORG,
    i.LAST_FUNDING_DATE_ORG
FROM RELEASES.RELEASE.INSIGHTS_LATEST i
JOIN RELEASES.RELEASE.ORG_LATEST co ON i.RBID_ORG = co.RBID
WHERE i.DEVELOPMENT_TECH_ORG LIKE '%Snowflake%'
  AND i.LAST_FUNDING_DATE_ORG >= DATEADD(month, -6, CURRENT_DATE())
ORDER BY i.LAST_FUNDING_DATE_ORG DESC;
```

<Tip>Array containment syntax varies: Snowflake often uses `ARRAY_CONTAINS(value, array)` or `array IN (SELECT value FROM table)`. BigQuery uses `value IN UNNEST(array)`. Check your warehouse docs and adjust the filter accordingly.</Tip>
