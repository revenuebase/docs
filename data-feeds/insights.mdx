# Insights table

The `insights` table contains enrichment signals and derived intelligence about companies and contacts. Use it to prioritize accounts based on buying signals, identify companies going through growth or change, and layer intent-like signals into your targeting. Insights can be company-level (`contact_id` is null) or contact-level (`contact_id` is set).

## Where the data comes from

Insights are derived from multiple sources: technographic data from website and stack detection, hiring data from job boards and career pages, funding data from press and regulatory filings, and engagement-style signals where available. Data is updated with each monthly release; recency varies by signal type.

## Counts and coverage

Insight record count depends on your subscription and which products (e.g. technographics, hiring, funding) are enabled. Not every company or contact has insights; fill rates are highest for companies with a clear web presence and for venture-backed companies (funding). Use the fill-rate query below to see coverage for your dataset.

## Table stats

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Total records** | Varies by subscription; one row per insight event or snapshot |
| **Update frequency** | Monthly (aligned with contacts and companies release) |
| **Primary key** | `insight_id` |
| **Main foreign keys** | `company_id` → `companies.company_id`, `contact_id` → `contacts.contact_id` (optional) |

## Data dictionary & fill rates

Fill rates vary significantly by insight type. Technographic data is available for companies with a detectable web/tech footprint; funding data is richest for venture-backed companies; hiring signals depend on public job postings.

### Identifiers

| Field | Type | Fill rate | Description |
|-------|------|-----------|-------------|
| `insight_id` | VARCHAR | 100% | Unique identifier for this insight record |
| `company_id` | VARCHAR | _TODO_% | Foreign key to `companies` table |
| `contact_id` | VARCHAR | _TODO_% | Foreign key to `contacts` table (NULL for company-level insights) |
| `insight_type` | VARCHAR | _TODO_% | Category: `technographic`, `hiring`, `funding`, `growth`, `engagement` |

<Info>When **contact_id** is null, the insight applies to the **company** (e.g. “company uses Snowflake”). When **contact_id** is set, the insight applies to that **contact** (e.g. “contact engaged with X”). Filter or join accordingly to avoid double-counting or mixing company- and contact-level signals.</Info>

### Technographic signals

| Field | Type | Fill rate | Description |
|-------|------|-----------|-------------|
| `technologies_detected` | ARRAY | _TODO_% | List of technologies detected on the company's website/stack |
| `tech_category` | VARCHAR | _TODO_% | Technology category (e.g., `CRM`, `marketing_automation`, `analytics`) |
| `tech_added_date` | DATE | _TODO_% | When the technology was first detected |
| `tech_removed_date` | DATE | _TODO_% | When the technology was last detected (NULL if still active) |

<Warning>**technologies_detected** is a nested/array field. Use your warehouse’s array functions to filter (e.g. `ARRAY_CONTAINS`, `LIST_CONTAINS`, or unnest). Syntax varies by platform (Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift).</Warning>

### Hiring signals

| Field | Type | Fill rate | Description |
|-------|------|-----------|-------------|
| `is_hiring` | BOOLEAN | _TODO_% | Whether the company currently has open roles |
| `open_roles_count` | INTEGER | _TODO_% | Number of open job postings |
| `hiring_departments` | ARRAY | _TODO_% | Departments with open roles (e.g. `['engineering', 'sales']`) |
| `headcount_growth_6m` | FLOAT | _TODO_% | Headcount growth rate over the last 6 months (e.g. 0.15 = 15%) |
| `headcount_growth_12m` | FLOAT | _TODO_% | Headcount growth rate over the last 12 months |

### Funding & financial signals

| Field | Type | Fill rate | Description |
|-------|------|-----------|-------------|
| `recent_funding` | BOOLEAN | _TODO_% | Whether the company raised funding in the last 12 months |
| `funding_round_type` | VARCHAR | _TODO_% | Most recent round: `seed`, `series_a`, `series_b`, `series_c`, `growth`, `other` |
| `funding_amount` | FLOAT | _TODO_% | Amount raised in the most recent round (USD) |
| `funding_date` | DATE | _TODO_% | Date of the most recent funding round |
| `total_funding` | FLOAT | _TODO_% | Total funding raised to date (USD) |

### Growth indicators

| Field | Type | Fill rate | Description |
|-------|------|-----------|-------------|
| `web_traffic_trend` | VARCHAR | _TODO_% | Website traffic trend: `growing`, `stable`, `declining` |
| `web_traffic_rank` | INTEGER | _TODO_% | Relative traffic rank (lower = more traffic) |
| `social_presence_score` | FLOAT | _TODO_% | Composite social media presence score (0–100) |
| `news_mentions_30d` | INTEGER | _TODO_% | Number of news mentions in the last 30 days |

### Metadata

| Field | Type | Fill rate | Description |
|-------|------|-----------|-------------|
| `observed_at` | TIMESTAMP | 100% | When this insight was captured |
| `created_at` | TIMESTAMP | 100% | When this record was first added |
| `updated_at` | TIMESTAMP | 100% | When this record was last modified |

<Warning>**Fill rates vary significantly by insight type.** Technographic data is available for companies with a web presence. Funding data is primarily available for venture-backed companies. Hiring signals depend on whether the company posts jobs publicly.</Warning>

## Joining this table

Join **insights** to **companies** on `company_id` to attach firmographics, and optionally to **contacts** on `contact_id` when you have contact-level insights. Use `contact_id IS NULL` when you want only company-level insights.

### Insights + companies (signals with firmographics)

```sql
SELECT
    co.company_name,
    co.domain,
    co.industry,
    co.employee_count,
    i.insight_type,
    i.technologies_detected,
    i.is_hiring,
    i.headcount_growth_6m,
    i.recent_funding
FROM insights i
JOIN companies co ON i.company_id = co.company_id
WHERE i.contact_id IS NULL   -- company-level insights only
  AND co.employee_count BETWEEN 50 AND 500
  AND i.observed_at >= DATEADD(month, -3, CURRENT_DATE());
```

### Insights + contacts + companies (contact-level signals with full context)

```sql
SELECT
    c.first_name,
    c.last_name,
    c.email,
    c.title,
    co.company_name,
    co.domain,
    i.insight_type,
    i.observed_at
FROM insights i
JOIN contacts c ON i.contact_id = c.contact_id
JOIN companies co ON c.company_id = co.company_id
WHERE i.insight_type = 'engagement'
ORDER BY i.observed_at DESC;
```

## How to calculate fill rates

Use this pattern to see how many records have each insight type and how complete key fields are.

```sql
SELECT
    insight_type,
    COUNT(*) AS record_count,
    ROUND(COUNT(technologies_detected) * 100.0 / COUNT(*), 1) AS tech_fill_pct,
    ROUND(COUNT(is_hiring) * 100.0 / COUNT(*), 1) AS hiring_fill_pct,
    ROUND(COUNT(recent_funding) * 100.0 / COUNT(*), 1) AS funding_fill_pct,
    ROUND(COUNT(headcount_growth_6m) * 100.0 / COUNT(*), 1) AS growth_fill_pct
FROM insights
WHERE contact_id IS NULL
GROUP BY insight_type;
```

## Sample queries

### Find companies showing growth signals (hiring + headcount growth)

**What you’re finding:** Companies that are growing headcount and actively hiring — strong candidates for sales or hiring tools.

**Why these fields:** `headcount_growth_6m` and `is_hiring` are the main growth signals. We join to **companies** to filter by size (`employee_count`) and to get `company_name` and `domain`. `recent_funding` and `funding_round_type` add optional context for prioritization.

**Logic:** Restrict to company-level insights, require meaningful headcount growth and hiring, and limit to a mid-market size band. Order by growth rate so the hottest accounts are first.

```sql
SELECT
    co.company_name,
    co.domain,
    co.employee_count,
    i.headcount_growth_6m,
    i.open_roles_count,
    i.recent_funding,
    i.funding_round_type
FROM insights i
JOIN companies co ON i.company_id = co.company_id
WHERE i.contact_id IS NULL
  AND i.headcount_growth_6m > 0.20
  AND i.is_hiring = TRUE
  AND co.employee_count BETWEEN 50 AND 500
ORDER BY i.headcount_growth_6m DESC;
```

### Companies that recently adopted a specific technology

**What you’re finding:** Accounts that added a technology (e.g. Snowflake) in the last 6 months — good for competitive displacement or upsell plays.

**Why these fields:** `technologies_detected` (array) is filtered for the product name; `tech_added_date` restricts to recent adoption. We join to **companies** for name and domain. Array syntax in the WHERE clause depends on your warehouse (see call-out above).

**Logic:** Filter to technographic insights, require the technology to be in the detected list, and limit to the last 6 months. Order by `tech_added_date` descending so the most recent adopters appear first.

```sql
SELECT
    co.company_name,
    co.domain,
    i.technologies_detected,
    i.tech_added_date
FROM insights i
JOIN companies co ON i.company_id = co.company_id
WHERE i.contact_id IS NULL
  AND i.insight_type = 'technographic'
  AND ARRAY_CONTAINS('Snowflake'::VARIANT, i.technologies_detected)   -- Snowflake syntax; adjust for your warehouse
  AND i.tech_added_date >= DATEADD(month, -6, CURRENT_DATE())
ORDER BY i.tech_added_date DESC;
```

<Tip>Array containment syntax varies: Snowflake often uses `ARRAY_CONTAINS(value, array)` or `array IN (SELECT value FROM table)`. BigQuery uses `value IN UNNEST(array)`. Check your warehouse docs and adjust the filter accordingly.</Tip>
