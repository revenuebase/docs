## Insights

The **Insights** table holds derived or aggregated insight data you can join to people and companies. Use it for scoring, signals, or other analytical attributes.

### What it is

Insights provide additional dimensions for contacts and companies — for example, intent scores, engagement signals, or segment flags. Each row typically links to a contact and/or company and carries one or more insight fields.

### What's in it

| Column       | Type     | Description                         |
| ------------ | -------- | ----------------------------------- |
| id           | bigint   | Unique primary key.                 |
| contact_id   | bigint   | Foreign key to Contacts (optional).|
| company_id   | bigint   | Foreign key to Companies (optional).|
| insight_type | string   | Type or category of insight.       |
| value        | string   | Insight value or score.             |
| updated_at   | timestamp| Last update time (UTC).             |

Add or replace columns to match your actual schema. Use the [Data dictionary](/data-feeds/data-dictionary) for full definitions.

### How to use it

- **Joining** — Join to [Contacts](/data-feeds/contacts) and [Companies](/data-feeds/companies) on the ID columns. See [Joining tables](/data-feeds/joining-tables) and [Pre-Joined Tables](/data-feeds/pre-joined-overview) for combined views.
- **Filtering** — Filter by `insight_type`, entity IDs, or date as needed.
