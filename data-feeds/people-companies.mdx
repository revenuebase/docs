---

The `people_companies` view combines every contact record with its associated company firmographic data in a single flat table. No joins required — just query directly.

## What's included

This view is equivalent to:

```sql
SELECT c.*, co.*
FROM contacts c
LEFT JOIN companies co ON c.company_id = co.company_id
```

Every contact field plus every company field, joined for you.

{/* TODO: Fill in actual numbers */}

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Total records** | _TODO_ (one row per contact) |
| **Primary key** | `contact_id` |
| **Source tables** | `contacts` LEFT JOIN `companies` |

## Data dictionary & fill rates
