## People + Companies

**People + Companies** is a pre-joined table that combines [Contacts](/data-feeds/contacts) (people) and [Companies](/data-feeds/companies) in one view. Each row represents one contact with their associated company attributes already joined.

### What it is

Instead of joining `contacts` and `companies` yourself, you query this view and get contact and company columns on the same row. Useful for lists, exports, and reporting where you need both person and company fields.

### Key columns (placeholder)

| Column           | Type     | Description                    |
| ---------------- | -------- | ------------------------------ |
| contact_id       | bigint   | Unique contact identifier.     |
| company_id       | bigint   | Unique company identifier.     |
| email            | string   | Contact email.                 |
| company_name     | string   | Company name.                  |
| _..._            | _..._    | Other contact/company fields.  |

Exact columns depend on your schema. Use the [Data dictionary](/data-feeds/data-dictionary) for the full list.

### Example query

```sql
SELECT contact_id, email, company_name
FROM people_companies
WHERE company_name ILIKE '%Tech%'
LIMIT 100;
```

Replace `people_companies` and column names with your actual view name and schema.
