## Joining tables

This page explains how RevenueBase data feed tables relate to each other, which keys to use for joins, and common pitfalls.

### Relationship overview

- **Table A** (e.g., companies) is the primary entity table.
- **Table B** (e.g., contacts) references Table A via a foreign key (e.g., `table_a_id`).

Other tables may reference Table A or Table B similarly. Document each relationship on the relevant table pages and summarize here.

### Join keys

| From table | To table   | Join key              | Relationship   |
| ---------- | ---------- | --------------------- | -------------- |
| Table B    | Table A    | `table_b.table_a_id = table_a.id` | Many-to-one   |

Use these keys in your `JOIN` conditions. Column names may differ in your real schema; adjust accordingly.

### Example joins

**Table B to Table A (many-to-one):**

```sql
SELECT a.id, a.name, b.id AS contact_id, b.email
FROM table_a a
JOIN table_b b ON b.table_a_id = a.id;
```

**Only rows that have a match in both tables (INNER JOIN):**

```sql
SELECT a.name, COUNT(b.id) AS contact_count
FROM table_a a
JOIN table_b b ON b.table_a_id = a.id
GROUP BY a.id, a.name;
```

**Include Table A rows with no Table B rows (LEFT JOIN):**

```sql
SELECT a.name, b.email
FROM table_a a
LEFT JOIN table_b b ON b.table_a_id = a.id;
```

### Gotchas and best practices

1. **Cardinality** — Table B may have many rows per Table A row. Aggregating or limiting per entity can avoid duplicates in reporting.
2. **Nulls** — Foreign key columns are usually non-null when the relationship is required; optional relationships may allow nulls. Check the [Data dictionary](/data-feeds/data-dictionary) and table pages.
3. **Performance** — Join on indexed columns (typically primary and foreign keys). Large tables may require filters or limits during development.
4. **Naming** — Table and column names may be case-sensitive depending on the engine; use the exact names from the schema.

For table-specific details, see [Table A](/data-feeds/table-a) and [Table B](/data-feeds/table-b).
