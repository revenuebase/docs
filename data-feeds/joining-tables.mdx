This page explains how RevenueBase data feed tables relate to each other, which keys to use for joins, and common pitfalls.

### Relationship overview

- **Companies** is the primary entity table for organizations.
- **Contacts** (people) reference Companies via a foreign key (e.g., `company_id`).
- **Insights** reference Companies only (company-level insights).

Document each relationship on the relevant table pages and summarize here.

### Join keys

| From table | To table   | Join key                        | Relationship   |
| ---------- | ---------- | ------------------------------- | -------------- |
| Contacts   | Companies  | `per.RBID_ORG = org.RBID` | Many-to-one   |
| Insights   | Companies  | `insights.RBID_ORG = org.RBID`  | Many-to-one   |
| Contacts   | Insights   | `per.RBID_ORG = insights.RBID_ORG`   | Many-to-one   |

Use these keys in your `JOIN` conditions. Column names may differ in your real schema; adjust accordingly.

### Example joins

**Contacts to Companies (many-to-one):**

```sql
SELECT c.RBID_PER, c.EMAIL_ADDRESS, co.COMPANY_NAME
FROM RELEASES.RELEASE.PER_LATEST c
JOIN RELEASES.RELEASE.ORG_LATEST co ON c.RBID_ORG = co.RBID;
```

**Include company rows with no contacts (LEFT JOIN):**

```sql
SELECT co.COMPANY_NAME, c.EMAIL_ADDRESS
FROM RELEASES.RELEASE.ORG_LATEST co
LEFT JOIN RELEASES.RELEASE.PER_LATEST c ON c.RBID_ORG = co.RBID;
```

**Contacts with Insights (company-level insights):**

```sql
SELECT c.EMAIL_ADDRESS, i.CRM_TECH_ORG, i.SALES_ROLE_COUNT_ORG
FROM RELEASES.RELEASE.PER_LATEST c
JOIN RELEASES.RELEASE.INSIGHTS_LATEST i ON c.RBID_ORG = i.RBID_ORG;
```

### Gotchas and best practices

1. **Cardinality** — Contacts may have many rows per Company. Aggregating or limiting per entity can avoid duplicates in reporting.
2. **Nulls** — Foreign key columns are usually non-null when the relationship is required; optional relationships may allow nulls. Check the [Data dictionary](/data-feeds/data-dictionary) and table pages.
3. **Performance** — Join on indexed columns (typically primary and foreign keys). Large tables may require filters or limits during development.
4. **Pre-joined views** — For common combinations (people + companies, or + insights), use [Pre-Joined Tables](/data-feeds/pre-joined-overview) instead of writing joins yourself.

For table-specific details, see [Companies](/data-feeds/companies), [Contacts](/data-feeds/contacts), [Insights](/data-feeds/insights), and [Historical Experience](/data-feeds/historical-experience).
