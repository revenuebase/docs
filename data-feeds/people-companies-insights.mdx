**People + Companies + Insights** is a pre-joined table that combines [Contacts](/data-feeds/contacts), [Companies](/data-feeds/companies), and [Insights](/data-feeds/insights) in one view. Each row represents a contact with company and company-level insight attributes already joined.

### What it is

Use this view when you need contact, company, and company-level insight (e.g., technographics, hiring signals) columns in a single query. No need to join the three base tables yourself — the view is maintained for you. Note that all insights are company-level only.

### Key columns (placeholder)
