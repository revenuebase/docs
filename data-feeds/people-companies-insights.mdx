## People + Companies + Insights

**People + Companies + Insights** is a pre-joined table that combines [Contacts](/data-feeds/contacts), [Companies](/data-feeds/companies), and [Insights](/data-feeds/insights) in one view. Each row represents a contact with company and insight attributes already joined.

### What it is

Use this view when you need contact, company, and insight (e.g., scores or signals) columns in a single query. No need to join the three base tables yourself — the view is maintained for you.

### Key columns (placeholder)

| Column           | Type     | Description                    |
| ---------------- | -------- | ------------------------------ |
| contact_id       | bigint   | Unique contact identifier.    |
| company_id       | bigint   | Unique company identifier.    |
| email            | string   | Contact email.                 |
| company_name     | string   | Company name.                 |
| insight_type     | string   | Type of insight.              |
| insight_value    | string   | Insight value or score.       |
| _..._            | _..._    | Other fields.                  |

Exact columns depend on your schema. Use the [Data dictionary](/data-feeds/data-dictionary) for the full list.

### Example query

```sql
SELECT contact_id, email, company_name, insight_type, insight_value
FROM people_companies_insights
WHERE insight_type = 'intent_score'
LIMIT 100;
```

Replace `people_companies_insights` and column names with your actual view name and schema.
