## Tables & Schema

RevenueBase data feeds are organized into tables. This page lists the main tables and what they contain. Use the linked table pages for column-level detail.

### Available tables

| Table      | Description                                      | Link        |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ----------- |
| Table A    | Sample table A — companies or core entities.     | [Table A](/data-feeds/table-a) |
| Table B    | Sample table B — contacts or related entities.   | [Table B](/data-feeds/table-b) |

Add more rows here as you add table pages. Each table page should describe:

- What the table represents.
- Key columns and how to use them.
- How it relates to other tables (join keys).
- Any filters or conventions (e.g., active-only flags).

### Schema conventions

- **Primary keys** — Each table has a unique identifier column (e.g., `id`). Use it for joins and deduplication.
- **Foreign keys** — Columns that reference another table’s primary key are documented on the table pages and in [Joining tables](/data-feeds/joining-tables).
- **Timestamps** — Many tables include `created_at` and/or `updated_at` in UTC.

### Next steps

- Open a table page (e.g., [Table A](/data-feeds/table-a), [Table B](/data-feeds/table-b)) for full column lists and examples.
- Read [Joining tables](/data-feeds/joining-tables) to see how tables relate and recommended join patterns.
