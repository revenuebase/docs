RevenueBase data feeds are organized into tables. This page lists the main tables and what they contain. Use the linked table pages for column-level detail.

### Available tables

| Table                | Description                                      |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| [Companies](/data-feeds/companies) | Organizations — primary entity table.           |
| [Contacts](/data-feeds/contacts)   | People — link to companies via `company_id`.     |
| [Insights](/data-feeds/insights)   | Derived insight data (scores, signals).          |
| [Historical Experience](/data-feeds/historical-experience) | Job/experience history for contacts. |

### Schema conventions

- **Primary keys** — Each table has a unique identifier column (e.g., `id`). Use it for joins and deduplication.
- **Foreign keys** — Columns that reference another table’s primary key are documented on the table pages and in [Joining tables](/data-feeds/joining-tables).
- **Timestamps** — Many tables include `created_at` and/or `updated_at` in UTC.

### Next steps

- Open a table page for full column lists and examples.
- Read [Joining tables](/data-feeds/joining-tables) to see how tables relate and recommended join patterns.
- Use [Pre-Joined Tables](/data-feeds/pre-joined-overview) for ready-made views that combine people, companies, and insights.
