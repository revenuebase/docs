Use this page to resolve common issues when connecting to or querying RevenueBase Dynamic Data Feeds. For general questions about data organization, delivery, and updates, see the [FAQ](/data-feeds/faq).

## AWS S3

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="InvalidAccessPointAlias error">
    This error typically occurs when using the **AWS Console** instead of the **AWS CLI**, or when the region is misconfigured.

    - Use the **AWS CLI** — the Console web UI does not support `--request-payer` and will return access errors
    - Confirm you're targeting the correct region in your CLI command
    - Verify your AWS account has been linked to the RevenueBase bucket

    If the issue persists, contact your RevenueBase onboarding representative or **support@revenuebase.ai**.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Access Denied or bucket not found">
    - Double-check that you're including `--request-payer requester` in your CLI command
    - Verify your AWS credentials are configured correctly (`aws configure`)
    - Ensure the bucket alias or ARN is copied exactly as provided — typos in the access point name are common
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Snowflake

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Share not visible">
    - Confirm your Snowflake account locator and region match what was provided to RevenueBase during onboarding. See <a href="https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/admin-account-identifier" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Snowflake's account identifier documentation</a> for where to find this information.
    - Check the **Data Sharing** area in the Snowflake UI for the RevenueBase incoming share
    - If you recently onboarded, allow up to 24 hours for the share to propagate
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Data and fields

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Missing RBID_ORG or RBID_PAO fields">
    These fields may be null when a person's LinkedIn profile doesn't link to a company page. The company name on LinkedIn is free text, so some profiles will not have a resolvable organization ID. A valid company email is the strongest indicator that the person-organization association is accurate.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Logo URLs returning 403 errors">
    LinkedIn periodically rotates logo URLs. Updated URLs are included in each monthly data refresh. For reliable access, we recommend building a **logo cache** on your end and populating it incrementally with each delivery.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
