# Historical experience table

The `historical_experience` table tracks career history for contacts in the RevenueBase database. Each row represents one position a contact has held (past or current). Use it to understand career trajectories, identify recent job changers, find alumni of specific companies, and build more personalized outreach.

## Where the data comes from

Historical experience is derived from professional profiles and public career history. Positions are normalized to titles, seniority, and department where possible. Start and end dates are captured with the precision available from the source (sometimes year-only for older roles). Tenure is calculated from those dates.

## Counts and coverage

Record count is larger than the contacts table because one contact can have many positions. Not every contact has historical experience; fill rates are higher for recent roles and for people with detailed public profiles. Use the fill-rate query below to see coverage and average positions per contact.

## Table stats

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Total records** | One row per position; exceeds contact count |
| **Update frequency** | Monthly (aligned with contacts release) |
| **Primary key** | `experience_id` |
| **Main foreign keys** | `contact_id` → `contacts.contact_id`, `company_id` → `companies.company_id` (when company is in our DB) |

## Data dictionary & fill rates

Fill rates for historical data are typically lower than for current-position data. Older positions, smaller companies, and non-US contacts tend to have less complete records. `start_date` and `end_date` may have year or year-month precision only in some cases.

### Identifiers

| Field | Type | Fill rate | Description |
|-------|------|-----------|-------------|
| `experience_id` | VARCHAR | 100% | Unique identifier for this experience record |
| `contact_id` | VARCHAR | 100% | Foreign key to `contacts` table |
| `company_id` | VARCHAR | _TODO_% | Foreign key to `companies` table (NULL if company not in our database) |

### Position details

| Field | Type | Fill rate | Description |
|-------|------|-----------|-------------|
| `title` | VARCHAR | _TODO_% | Job title held during this position |
| `seniority_level` | VARCHAR | _TODO_% | Normalized seniority: `c_suite`, `vp`, `director`, `manager`, `senior`, `entry`, `other` |
| `department` | VARCHAR | _TODO_% | Functional department during this role |
| `is_current` | BOOLEAN | _TODO_% | Whether this is the contact’s current position |

<Info>**One row per position.** A contact with 5 jobs has 5 rows; one will have `is_current = TRUE`, the rest `is_current = FALSE`. Use `is_current` to isolate current role or to find previous roles when building “previous company” logic.</Info>

### Company context

| Field | Type | Fill rate | Description |
|-------|------|-----------|-------------|
| `company_name` | VARCHAR | _TODO_% | Company name for this position |
| `company_domain` | VARCHAR | _TODO_% | Company domain for this position |
| `company_industry` | VARCHAR | _TODO_% | Industry of the company at this position |
| `company_employee_count` | INTEGER | _TODO_% | Employee count of the company (at time of record) |

### Dates & tenure

| Field | Type | Fill rate | Description |
|-------|------|-----------|-------------|
| `start_date` | DATE | _TODO_% | When the contact started this position |
| `end_date` | DATE | _TODO_% | When the contact left (NULL if current) |
| `tenure_months` | INTEGER | _TODO_% | Calculated tenure in months (NULL if current) |

<Note>**tenure_months** is derived from `start_date` and `end_date`. It is NULL for current positions. For past positions, use it for tenure-based filters (e.g. “held role at least 24 months”) or analytics.</Note>

### Addresses (location for this role)

The historical experience table does **not** store address fields (street, city, state, country) for the position. Location context for a past or current role comes from the **companies** table.

| Approach | When to use |
|----------|-------------|
| **Join to companies** | When you have `company_id` and need HQ address (e.g. `companies.hq_city`, `companies.hq_country`) for that employer. |
| **Contact’s current location** | For “where does this person live now,” use **contacts** (`location_city`, `location_state`, `location_country`), not historical experience. |

<Tip>To analyze “contacts who worked in California” or “alumni of companies in EMEA,” join `historical_experience` to `companies` on `company_id` and filter on `companies.hq_state` or `companies.hq_country`.</Tip>

### Metadata

| Field | Type | Fill rate | Description |
|-------|------|-----------|-------------|
| `created_at` | TIMESTAMP | 100% | When this record was first added |
| `updated_at` | TIMESTAMP | 100% | When this record was last modified |

<Warning>**Fill rates for historical data are inherently lower** than for current-position data. Older positions, smaller companies, and non-US contacts tend to have less complete records. `company_id` may be null when the employer is not in the RevenueBase companies table.</Warning>

## Common use cases

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Find recent job changers">
    People who just started a new role are often more receptive to new tools. Target contacts whose most recent position started within the last 90 days (`is_current = TRUE` and `start_date` in last 90 days).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Company alumni targeting">
    Find everyone who used to work at a specific company (`company_domain` or `company_id`) and `is_current = FALSE`. Useful for selling to former champions who already know your space.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Career trajectory analysis">
    Compare seniority and title across a contact’s positions to see if they are trending toward more senior roles (e.g. decision-maker) or have been lateral (e.g. evaluator/user).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Tenure-based signals">
    Short average tenure can indicate high turnover; long tenure at current role can indicate stability and buying authority. Use `tenure_months` and `is_current` in analytics or filters.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Joining this table

Join **historical_experience** to **contacts** on `contact_id` to get current contact info (email, title, company). Join to **companies** on `company_id` when the employer is in our DB and you need firmographics or HQ address for that role.

### Historical experience + contacts (recent job changers with contact info)

```sql
SELECT
    c.first_name,
    c.last_name,
    c.email,
    he.title AS new_title,
    he.company_name AS new_company,
    he.start_date,
    c.title AS current_title_in_feed
FROM historical_experience he
JOIN contacts c ON he.contact_id = c.contact_id
WHERE he.is_current = TRUE
  AND he.start_date >= DATEADD(day, -90, CURRENT_DATE())
  AND c.email_verified = TRUE
ORDER BY he.start_date DESC;
```

### Historical experience + contacts + companies (alumni with HQ location)

```sql
SELECT
    c.first_name,
    c.last_name,
    c.email,
    he.company_name AS former_employer,
    he.title AS former_title,
    he.start_date,
    he.end_date,
    he.tenure_months,
    co.hq_country,
    co.hq_city
FROM historical_experience he
JOIN contacts c ON he.contact_id = c.contact_id
LEFT JOIN companies co ON he.company_id = co.company_id
WHERE he.company_domain = 'salesforce.com'
  AND he.is_current = FALSE
  AND c.email_verified = TRUE
ORDER BY he.end_date DESC;
```

## How to calculate fill rates

Use this to see how many positions you have, how many contacts have history, and how complete key fields are.

```sql
SELECT
    COUNT(*) AS total_position_records,
    COUNT(DISTINCT contact_id) AS contacts_with_history,
    ROUND(COUNT(*) * 1.0 / NULLIF(COUNT(DISTINCT contact_id), 0), 1) AS avg_positions_per_contact,
    ROUND(COUNT(company_id) * 100.0 / COUNT(*), 1) AS company_id_fill_pct,
    ROUND(COUNT(title) * 100.0 / COUNT(*), 1) AS title_fill_pct,
    ROUND(COUNT(start_date) * 100.0 / COUNT(*), 1) AS start_date_fill_pct,
    ROUND(COUNT(tenure_months) * 100.0 / COUNT(*), 1) AS tenure_fill_pct
FROM historical_experience;
```

## Sample queries

### Recent job changers (last 90 days) with previous role

**What you’re finding:** People who started a new job in the last 90 days, plus their previous title and company, for outreach or lead scoring.

**Why these fields:** We need current contact info (`c.first_name`, `c.last_name`, `c.email`) and the new role (`he.title`, `he.company_name`, `he.start_date`). The self-join to `prev` gets the most recent *previous* position (max `end_date` among non-current roles) so we can show “previous title” and “previous company.”

**Logic:** Restrict to current positions (`is_current = TRUE`) with `start_date` in the last 90 days. Join to contacts for email and filter on `email_verified`. The LEFT JOIN to `prev` is a “previous role” subquery pattern so we get one row per contact with their prior role when available.

```sql
SELECT
    c.first_name,
    c.last_name,
    c.email,
    he.title AS new_title,
    he.company_name AS new_company,
    he.start_date,
    prev.title AS previous_title,
    prev.company_name AS previous_company
FROM historical_experience he
JOIN contacts c ON he.contact_id = c.contact_id
LEFT JOIN historical_experience prev
  ON prev.contact_id = he.contact_id
  AND prev.is_current = FALSE
  AND prev.end_date = (
    SELECT MAX(end_date)
    FROM historical_experience
    WHERE contact_id = he.contact_id AND is_current = FALSE
  )
WHERE he.is_current = TRUE
  AND he.start_date >= DATEADD(day, -90, CURRENT_DATE())
  AND c.email_verified = TRUE
ORDER BY he.start_date DESC;
```

### Alumni of a specific company

**What you’re finding:** People who used to work at a given company (e.g. Salesforce), with current contact info and tenure at that company, for alumni campaigns or competitive targeting.

**Why these fields:** `company_domain` (or `company_id`) identifies the employer; `is_current = FALSE` ensures we only get past roles. We select contact info and current title/company from **contacts**, and from **historical_experience** we take the role they had there and tenure.

**Logic:** Filter by target company domain and non-current positions. Join to contacts for email and current context. Order by `end_date` descending so the most recent leavers appear first.

```sql
SELECT
    c.first_name,
    c.last_name,
    c.email,
    c.title AS current_title,
    c.company_name AS current_company,
    he.title AS former_title,
    he.start_date,
    he.end_date,
    he.tenure_months
FROM historical_experience he
JOIN contacts c ON he.contact_id = c.contact_id
WHERE he.company_domain = 'salesforce.com'
  AND he.is_current = FALSE
  AND c.email_verified = TRUE
ORDER BY he.end_date DESC;
```

### Average tenure by seniority level

**What you’re finding:** Typical tenure by seniority (e.g. do VPs stay longer than managers?) for segmentation or content strategy.

**Why these fields:** `seniority_level` groups the analysis; `tenure_months` is the metric. We exclude current positions (`tenure_months IS NOT NULL` implies a completed role) and use `AVG` and `MEDIAN` for robustness to outliers.

**Logic:** Filter to completed positions only, group by `seniority_level`, aggregate count and average/median tenure. Order by average tenure descending to see which levels tend to stay longest.

```sql
SELECT
    seniority_level,
    COUNT(*) AS positions,
    ROUND(AVG(tenure_months), 1) AS avg_tenure_months,
    ROUND(MEDIAN(tenure_months), 1) AS median_tenure_months
FROM historical_experience
WHERE tenure_months IS NOT NULL
  AND is_current = FALSE
GROUP BY seniority_level
ORDER BY avg_tenure_months DESC;
```
