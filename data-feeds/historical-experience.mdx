## Historical Experience

The **Historical Experience** table holds historical job or experience records — for example, employment history or role changes you can link to contacts and companies.

### What it is

Historical Experience adds a time dimension to people and companies: past roles, tenure, or experience attributes. Each row typically links to a contact and optionally to a company, with start/end or effective dates.

### What's in it

| Column       | Type     | Description                         |
| ------------ | -------- | ----------------------------------- |
| id           | bigint   | Unique primary key.                 |
| contact_id   | bigint   | Foreign key to Contacts.            |
| company_id   | bigint   | Foreign key to Companies (optional).|
| role_title   | string   | Job title or role.                  |
| start_date   | date     | Start of the experience.            |
| end_date     | date     | End of the experience (nullable).  |
| updated_at   | timestamp| Last update time (UTC).             |

Add or replace columns to match your actual schema. Use the [Data dictionary](/data-feeds/data-dictionary) for full definitions.

### How to use it

- **Filtering** — Filter by contact, company, date range, or role as needed.
