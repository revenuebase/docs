# Historical Experience Table

The `historical_experience` table tracks career history for contacts in the RevenueBase database. Each row represents one position a contact has held. Use it to understand career trajectories, identify recent job changers, find alumni of specific companies, and build more personalized outreach.

<Warning>
  **Fill rates for historical data are inherently lower** than current-position data. Older positions, smaller companies, and non-US contacts tend to have less complete records. `start_date` and `end_date` may only have year or year-month precision in some cases.
</Warning>

## Common use cases

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Find recent job changers">
    People who just started a new role are 3–5x more likely to buy new tools. Target contacts whose most recent position started within the last 90 days.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Company alumni targeting">
    Find everyone who used to work at a specific company — great for selling to former champions who already know your product.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Career trajectory analysis">
    Understand whether a contact is trending toward more senior roles (likely a decision-maker) or has been lateral (likely an evaluator/user).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Tenure-based signals">
    Short average tenure can indicate a company with high turnover. Long tenure at the current role can indicate stability and buying authority.
  </Accordion>

## Example queries

### Recent job changers (last 90 days)

```sql
SELECT
    c.first_name,
    c.last_name,
    c.email,
    he.title as new_title,
    he.company_name as new_company,
    he.start_date,
    prev.title as previous_title,
    prev.company_name as previous_company
FROM historical_experience he
JOIN contacts c ON he.contact_id = c.contact_id
LEFT JOIN historical_experience prev
  ON prev.contact_id = he.contact_id
  AND prev.is_current = FALSE
  AND prev.end_date = (
    SELECT MAX(end_date)
    FROM historical_experience
    WHERE contact_id = he.contact_id AND is_current = FALSE
  )
WHERE he.is_current = TRUE
  AND he.start_date >= DATEADD(day, -90, CURRENT_DATE())
  AND c.email_verified = TRUE
ORDER BY he.start_date DESC;
```

### Alumni of a specific company

```sql
SELECT
    c.first_name,
    c.last_name,
    c.email,
    c.title as current_title,

    he.title as former_title,
    he.start_date,
    he.end_date,
    he.tenure_months
FROM historical_experience he
JOIN contacts c ON he.contact_id = c.contact_id
WHERE he.company_domain = 'salesforce.com'  -- change to your target
  AND he.is_current = FALSE
  AND c.email_verified = TRUE
ORDER BY he.end_date DESC;
```

### Average tenure by seniority level

```sql
SELECT
    seniority_level,
    COUNT(*) as positions,
    ROUND(AVG(tenure_months), 1) as avg_tenure_months,
    ROUND(MEDIAN(tenure_months), 1) as median_tenure_months
FROM historical_experience
WHERE tenure_months IS NOT NULL
  AND is_current = FALSE
GROUP BY seniority_level
ORDER BY avg_tenure_months DESC;
```
