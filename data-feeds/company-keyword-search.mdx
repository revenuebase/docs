# Company keyword search

Building lists often starts with finding companies that match specific themes, technologies, or use cases. RevenueBase gives you several fields that are well suited to keyword and semantic search.

## Fields for keyword searching

Use these fields to run powerful company searches:

- **Company about us** — Free-text company description. Search for phrases that indicate product focus, mission, or market (e.g., "cloud-native", "AI-powered", "B2B SaaS").
- **Company keywords** — Normalized or tagged keywords associated with the company. Good for technology names, verticals, and use-case terms.
- **Industry fields** — `industry`, `sub_industry`, and related classification fields. Combine with keyword conditions to narrow by vertical and theme.

Combine these with firmographic filters (employee count, revenue, location) to build precise company lists without writing complex joins.

## Example searches

The following are placeholder examples for complex company keyword searches. Replace the field names and logic with your actual schema.

### Search 1

```sql
-- TODO: Complex company search 1 — e.g., about_us + industry
SELECT company_id, company_name, domain, industry, employee_count
FROM companies
WHERE 1=1
  -- AND <about_us_field> ILIKE '%<keyword>%'
  -- AND industry IN ('Software', 'Information Technology')
  -- AND employee_count BETWEEN 50 AND 500
LIMIT 100;
```

### Search 2

```sql
-- TODO: Complex company search 2 — e.g., company keywords + location
SELECT company_id, company_name, domain, industry, hq_city, hq_state
FROM companies
WHERE 1=1
  -- AND <company_keywords_field> ILIKE '%<keyword>%'
  -- AND hq_country = 'US'
  -- AND <sub_industry_field> = '<value>'
LIMIT 100;
```

### Search 3

```sql
-- TODO: Complex company search 3 — e.g., multi-keyword about us
SELECT company_id, company_name, domain, industry, employee_range
FROM companies
WHERE 1=1
  -- AND (<about_us_field> ILIKE '%<keyword1>%' OR <about_us_field> ILIKE '%<keyword2>%')
  -- AND employee_range IN ('51-200', '201-500')
LIMIT 100;
```

### Search 4

```sql
-- TODO: Complex company search 4 — e.g., keywords + revenue + sector
SELECT company_id, company_name, domain, industry, revenue_range, sector
FROM companies
WHERE 1=1
  -- AND <company_keywords_field> ILIKE '%<keyword>%'
  -- AND revenue_range IN ('$10-50M', '$50-100M')
  -- AND sector = '<value>'
LIMIT 100;
```

### Search 5

```sql
-- TODO: Complex company search 5 — e.g., about us + industry + founded year
SELECT company_id, company_name, domain, industry, founded_year, employee_count
FROM companies
WHERE 1=1
  -- AND <about_us_field> ILIKE '%<keyword>%'
  -- AND industry = '<value>'
  -- AND founded_year >= 2010
LIMIT 100;
```

<Tip>
Replace placeholder field names (e.g., `<about_us_field>`, `<company_keywords_field>`) and filter values with your actual [Companies](/data-feeds/companies) table schema. Use `ILIKE` for case-insensitive text search; for full-text or semantic search, use your platform’s native search features if available.
