## Data coverage

This page describes what data is available in RevenueBase feeds and how often it is updated.

### Geographic coverage

RevenueBase data currently focuses on:

- **United States** — Primary coverage for companies and contacts.
- **Other regions** — Coverage may be limited or in beta; check your contract or the dashboard for availability.

### Entity coverage

| Entity type | Description                    | Typical use case        |
| ----------- | ------------------------------ | ----------------------- |
| Companies   | Business records and firmographics | Enrichment, targeting   |
| Contacts    | People and contact info        | Sales and marketing     |
| Events      | Activity and events (if offered) | Analytics, triggers    |

Exact tables and columns depend on your plan. See [Tables & Schema](/data-feeds/tables-schema) for the list you have access to.

### Update frequency

- **Batch feeds** — Refreshed on a schedule (e.g., daily or weekly). Check your feed documentation or dashboard for the exact cadence.
- **Incremental / streaming** — Some feeds support incremental or near real-time updates; availability depends on your subscription.

### Data freshness and retention

- **Freshness** — Each table may have a different lag between source systems and the feed. Important for time-sensitive use cases.
- **Retention** — How long history is kept varies by table and plan. Contact support or check your agreement for retention details.

### Gaps and limitations

- Not every company or contact is present; coverage varies by industry and region.
- Some fields may be null when data is missing or not applicable.
- Use the [Data dictionary](/data-feeds/data-dictionary) and table pages to see which fields are required vs optional.

For questions about your specific coverage, refer to the [FAQ](/faq) or contact support.
