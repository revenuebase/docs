### API

**How do I get an API key?**  
Sign in to the <a href="https://app.revenuebase.ai/dashboard" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RevenueBase dashboard</a>, go to **Settings** → **API Keys**, and click **Create API key**. Copy and store the key securely. You can view and copy your API key anytime from **Settings** → **API Keys** in the dashboard.

**Why do I get 401 Unauthorized?**  
Check that you are sending the key in the **x-key** header (not `Authorization`). Ensure the key is correct and has not been revoked.

**Why do I get 429 Too Many Requests?**  
You have exceeded the rate limit. Wait for the window to reset or implement backoff. See [Rate limits and error codes](/api-reference/rate-limits).

**What does 422 Validation Error mean?**  
The request body or parameters failed validation. The response `detail` array lists each invalid field and message. Fix those fields and retry.

### Data feeds

**How do I get data feed credentials?**  
Feed credentials are separate from your API key. In the <a href="https://app.revenuebase.ai/dashboard" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dashboard</a>, open **Settings** → **Data Feeds** to see connection details and credentials.

**I can’t connect to the feed.**  
Verify host, port, and TLS settings. Ensure you are using the feed username and password, not the API key. Check firewall and network rules.

**A table or column is missing.**  
Table and schema access depend on your plan. Confirm the table name and schema (e.g., `public`) and check the [Tables & Schema](/data-feeds/tables-schema) and table pages ([Contacts](/data-feeds/contacts), [Companies](/data-feeds/companies), [Insights](/data-feeds/insights)).

**How often is feed data updated?**  
It depends on the feed and your plan. See [Data coverage](/data-feeds/data-coverage) for general guidance; exact refresh schedules may be in your contract or dashboard.
