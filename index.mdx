## The data

RevenueBase is a **B2B data foundation** — 375M+ contacts and 60M+ companies, continuously verified 
and refreshed. Every record ships with a verification timestamp and summary so you always know the 
freshness of what you're working with.

Three things that make the data useful for building:

- **Dynamic updates** — Records are re-verified on a rolling schedule (profiles every 90 days, emails
every 60 days). Your monthly delivery reflects the current state of the dataset, not a static snapshot.
- **Deterministic filters** — Slice by headcount, revenue, funding stage, industry, job title, seniority,
geography, tech stack, and more. Filters are field-level and exact — no black-box scoring.
- **Semantic search** — Query by meaning, not just keywords. "Ambulatory care facilities in Texas" or 
"the person responsible for data infrastructure at Series B fintechs" — blends natural language with 
structured filters in a single query.
