# Intro to RevenueBase

RevenueBase is the data infrastructure layer underneath your go-to-market stack. We provide 350M+ contacts and 60M+ companies with continuous verification — plus AI-powered tools to clean, enrich, and discover data on demand. Core data ships unmetered on a flat subscription. Tools run on per-outcome pricing. Everything is built so AI agents and human teams work from the same trustworthy foundation.

## Built for how AI actually works

Legacy B2B data was designed for humans working in funnels: buy a list, run a campaign, qualify leads. AI agents don't work that way. They operate in continuous loops — observing, reasoning, acting, adjusting — and they break when the data underneath them is stale, incomplete, or metered in ways that starve experimentation.

RevenueBase is built for both audiences:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="For your team" icon="users">
    Sales, marketing, and ops teams query RevenueBase through our API, Snowflake data feeds, or integrations with the tools you already use. Every record includes verification metadata — source, freshness, deliverability score — so your team knows exactly what they're acting on.
  </Card>
  <Card title="For AI agents and automation" icon="microchip-ai">
    AI agents and automation workflows consume RevenueBase through the same API and data feeds, with unmetered access to core data so agents can query freely without hitting usage caps. We support llms.txt and MCP so AI systems can discover and use data programmatically. When your agents work from verified data, they target the right people, personalize accurately, and don't hallucinate contacts.

## Combine your data with ours

RevenueBase isn't a replacement for your proprietary data — it's the verified layer that makes your data complete. The real power comes from combining what you already know with what we continuously verify.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start with what you know">
    Your CRM records, product usage signals, customer interactions, and intent data contain context no external provider can replicate. That's your advantage.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Layer in RevenueBase">
    Match your accounts and contacts against RevenueBase by domain, email, or company ID. We fill coverage gaps — missing contacts, outdated emails, incomplete firmographics — and verify what you already have in real time.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Work from a complete, verified picture">
    Now your team targets the right people. Your AI agents work from accurate inputs. Your campaigns hit real inboxes. And every record is traceable to a verified source.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Power your product — not just your pipeline

RevenueBase operates at two levels, and this is what makes us different from traditional data vendors:

**Enrich your own operations.** Connect RevenueBase to your CRM, outbound tools, or data warehouse. Keep contact records current, fill coverage gaps, and maintain deliverability across your entire database.

**Embed verified data in your product.** If you're building a sales tool, data product, or GTM platform, RevenueBase is the data infrastructure underneath it. Our customers include data providers, sales intelligence platforms, and AI-native GTM tools that embed RevenueBase so the data they deliver to *their* customers is accurate and verified. Partners like Wiza, Clay, and Orbital run RevenueBase in production — every email they verify, every contact they surface, flows through our infrastructure.

<Tip>
  Whether you're enriching your own data or embedding RevenueBase in your product, the same API and data feeds power both use cases. Flat-rate, unmetered access to core data. Per-outcome pricing on verification and discovery tools.

## How it all fits together
