## Welcome

You're here because you care about data quality — not as a talking point, but as an engineering constraint. Bad data breaks pipelines, poisons models, bounces emails, and wastes your team's time. We built RevenueBase because we care about the same thing.

**RevenueBase is not just another data company selling contacts and companies. We're a data platform — one platform with three layers.** Start with clean data. Use tools to verify, merge, and enrich your own. Search the result. Each layer works on its own, but together they give you dynamically updated, enriched, searchable company and contact data, ready for whatever you run next.

- **Data feeds** can be accessed **directly** — via S3, Snowflake, Google Cloud Storage, Azure Blob Storage, or Gigasheet — so you get the full dataset in your infrastructure or in a spreadsheet UI.
- The **Trust layer** (verification, enrichment, and management tools) and the **Search layer** (discovery) are available **by API**, so you can clean your own data, merge it with RevenueBase, and find new contacts and companies programmatically.

**The Foundation (Data)** — 375M+ contacts and 60M+ companies, continuously refreshed and verified before they reach you. Every record includes a verification summary and timestamp. Clean, dynamic data you can build on immediately. Delivered via data feeds (S3, Snowflake, GCS, Azure, Gigasheet) or API. Flat subscription, unmetered access.

**The Trust layer** — Verify emails, resolve messy company names to canonical IDs, detect job changes, reconnect with contacts who moved. Merge your cleaned data with RevenueBase feeds and enrich with firmographics, tech stack, hiring signals, and custom attributes. Per-outcome pricing.

**The Search layer** — Find new companies and contacts using deterministic filters (headcount, funding, industry, job title, location) and semantic search that understands meaning (e.g. "ambulatory care facilities" or "the person who owns demand gen"). Combine both in a single query. Results come back enriched and verified. Per-outcome pricing.

These docs cover accessing data (feeds and Gigasheet), using the tools (API), and reference material (schema, API reference).

## How you access the data

There are two ways to get RevenueBase data into your workflow. Pick the one that fits how you work — or use both.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Direct Data Feeds" icon="database" href="/getting-started/quickstart-data-feeds">
    **Full dataset, delivered to your infrastructure.**

    Connect RevenueBase to your data warehouse or pipeline via Snowflake data share, Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, or Azure Blob Storage. You get the complete dataset — contacts, companies, firmographics, insight data — updating continuously. Set up the connection once, and your copy stays current as records are verified, updated, and added.

    This is the right choice if you're building data pipelines, powering internal analytics, feeding AI systems, or embedding RevenueBase in a product you ship to your own customers.

    Flat subscription. Unmetered access.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Gigasheet" icon="table" href="/getting-started/quickstart-gigasheet">
    **Spreadsheet-style access for your whole team.**

    Gigasheet gives you a browser-based UI on top of the full RevenueBase dataset. Search, filter, segment, enrich, and export — no SQL, no code, no engineering tickets. Add team members so sales, marketing, and ops can pull the data they need directly.

    This is the right choice if you want to explore the dataset before committing to a programmatic integration, run proof-of-concepts, or give non-technical team members direct access to verified contact and company data.

    Gigasheet is a flat subscription with unmetered access. The data feeds you use inside Gigasheet are separate subscriptions — you can subscribe to Gigasheet and add data feeds, or add Gigasheet to your existing data feed subscription.

Most customers use both. Data feeds power your systems and products. Gigasheet gives your people a window into the same data without waiting on engineering.

## How you work with the data

On top of the core dataset, RevenueBase provides tools you access through our [REST API](/getting-started/quickstart-api). These fall into two categories:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Verification & Enrichment Tools" icon="wrench" href="/api-reference/overview">
    **Clean and enhance your own data.**

    These tools operate on whatever you send — your CRM records, third-party lists, product databases. Email verification validates deliverability in real time or in batch. Company Match resolves messy company names to canonical IDs. Reconnect detects job changes and finds where contacts moved. Contextual Enrichment adds firmographics, tech stack, hiring signals, or custom attributes.

    Run these against your first-party data, then merge the cleaned result with RevenueBase feeds for a complete, deduplicated dataset.

    Per-outcome pricing.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Discovery" icon="magnifying-glass" href="/api-reference/company-match-overview">
    **Find new contacts and companies.**

    Discovery combines deterministic filters (headcount, funding stage, industry code, job title, geography) with semantic search that interprets meaning. "Ambulatory care facilities in Texas with 200+ employees" blends semantic understanding with structured filters in a single query. "The person responsible for data infrastructure at Series B fintechs" blends a semantic role with deterministic company attributes.

    Results return enriched and verified by default — they flow through the same data and verification infrastructure underneath.

## What ships with every record

Every record in RevenueBase — whether it comes from a feed, an API call, or a discovery query — includes verification metadata. This is the default, not a premium tier.

<Accordion title="Verification fields on every record">
  - **Source provenance** — Where the record originated (LinkedIn profile, company website, public filing, etc.)
  - **Verification timestamp** — When the record was last checked, in UTC
  - **Verification summary** — A human-readable and machine-parseable summary of verification status across contact fields

  See [Verification Summaries](/data-feeds/verification-summaries) for the full schema and how to use these fields in filters, scoring logic, or agent decision workflows.
</Accordion>

This matters because your systems are making decisions based on this data. If you're building a product, your users and your compliance team can audit any record end-to-end. If you're feeding data to AI agents, the verification timestamp and verification summary give your automation a programmatic signal to act on a record or flag it for review.

## Quickstarts

<Steps>
  <Step title="Connect data feeds">
    [Data Feeds Quickstart](/getting-started/quickstart-data-feeds) — Configure delivery via Snowflake or S3, understand the table schema (contacts, companies, insights, and pre-joined views), and learn how joins work across tables.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Explore in Gigasheet">
    [Gigasheet Quickstart](/getting-started/quickstart-gigasheet) — Search, filter, enrich, and export RevenueBase data in a browser. Add team members, build segments, and verify data quality — no code required.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Integrate via API">
    [API Quickstart](/getting-started/quickstart-api) — Get an API key, make your first verification call, and see the response schema. Covers authentication, endpoints, rate limits, and error handling.
  </Step>
</Steps>
