# Welcome to RevenueBase

## Welcome

You're here because you care about data quality — not as a talking point, but as an engineering constraint. Bad data breaks pipelines, poisons models, bounces emails, and wastes your team's time. We built RevenueBase because we care about the same thing.

RevenueBase gives you 375M+ contacts and 60M+ companies, continuously verified, with source provenance on every record. Core data is flat-rate and unmetered — no per-record fees, no throttling. On top of that: verification, enrichment, and AI-powered search tools priced per outcome, so you pay when we deliver a result, not when you make a request.

These docs cover everything you need to get up and running: how to access the data, how the tools work, API references, schema documentation, and the Gigasheet UI for teams that want to work with the data without writing code.

## How you access the data

There are two ways to get RevenueBase data into your workflow. Pick the one that fits how you work — or use both.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Direct Data Feeds" icon="database" href="/getting-started/quickstart-data-feeds">
    **Full dataset, delivered to your infrastructure.**

    Connect RevenueBase to your data warehouse or pipeline via Snowflake data share, Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, or Azure Blob Storage. You get the complete dataset — contacts, companies, firmographics, enrichment signals — updating continuously. Set up the connection once, and your copy stays current as records are verified, updated, and added.

    This is the right choice if you're building data pipelines, powering internal analytics, feeding AI systems, or embedding RevenueBase in a product you ship to your own customers.

    Flat subscription. Unmetered access.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Gigasheet" icon="table" href="/getting-started/quickstart-gigasheet">
    **Spreadsheet-style access for your whole team.**

    Gigasheet gives you a browser-based UI on top of the full RevenueBase dataset. Search, filter, segment, enrich, and export — no SQL, no code, no engineering tickets. Add team members so sales, marketing, and ops can pull the data they need directly.

    This is the right choice if you want to explore the dataset before committing to a programmatic integration, run proof-of-concepts, or give non-technical team members direct access to verified contact and company data.

    Gigasheet is a flat subscription with unmetered access. The data feeds you use inside Gigasheet are separate subscriptions — you can subscribe to Gigasheet and add data feeds, or add Gigasheet to your existing data feed subscription.

</CardGroup>

Most customers use both. Data feeds power your systems and products. Gigasheet gives your people a window into the same data without waiting on engineering.

## How you work with the data

On top of the core dataset, RevenueBase provides tools you access through our [REST API](/getting-started/quickstart-api). These fall into two categories:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Verification & Enrichment Tools" icon="wrench" href="/api-reference/overview">
    **Clean and enhance your own data.**

    These tools operate on whatever you send — your CRM records, third-party lists, product databases. Email verification validates deliverability in real time or in batch. Company Match resolves messy company names to canonical IDs. Reconnect detects job changes and finds where contacts moved. Contextual Enrichment adds firmographics, tech stack, hiring signals, or custom attributes.

    Run these against your first-party data, then merge the cleaned result with RevenueBase feeds for a complete, deduplicated dataset.

    Per-outcome pricing.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Discovery" icon="magnifying-glass" href="/api-reference/company-match-overview">
    **Find new contacts and companies.**

    Discovery combines deterministic filters (headcount, funding stage, industry code, job title, geography) with semantic search that interprets meaning. "Ambulatory care facilities in Texas with 200+ employees" blends semantic understanding with structured filters in a single query. "The person responsible for data infrastructure at Series B fintechs" blends a semantic role with deterministic company attributes.

    Results return enriched and verified by default — they flow through the same data and verification infrastructure underneath.

## What ships with every record

Every record in RevenueBase — whether it comes from a feed, an API call, or a discovery query — includes verification metadata. This is the default, not a premium tier.

<Accordion title="Verification fields on every record">
  - **Source provenance** — Where the record originated (LinkedIn profile, company website, public filing, etc.)
  - **Verification timestamp** — When the record was last checked, in UTC
  - **Verification summary** — A human-readable and machine-parseable summary of verification status across contact fields

  See [Verification Summaries](/data-feeds/verification-summaries) for the full schema and how to use these fields in filters, scoring logic, or agent decision workflows.
</Accordion>

This matters because your systems are making decisions based on this data. If you're building a product, your users and your compliance team can audit any record end-to-end. If you're feeding data to AI agents, the verification timestamp and verification summary give your automation a programmatic signal to act on a record or flag it for review.

## Quickstarts

<Steps>
  <Step title="Connect data feeds">
    [Data Feeds Quickstart](/getting-started/quickstart-data-feeds) — Configure delivery via Snowflake or S3, understand the table schema (contacts, companies, insights, and pre-joined views), and learn how joins work across tables.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Explore in Gigasheet">
    [Gigasheet Quickstart](/getting-started/quickstart-gigasheet) — Search, filter, enrich, and export RevenueBase data in a browser. Add team members, build segments, and verify data quality — no code required.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Integrate via API">
    [API Quickstart](/getting-started/quickstart-api) — Get an API key, make your first verification call, and see the response schema. Covers authentication, endpoints, rate limits, and error handling.
  </Step>
</Steps>
