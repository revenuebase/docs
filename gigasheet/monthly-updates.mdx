RevenueBase data in Gigasheet is refreshed on a regular schedule. No manual refresh is required.

## Automatic monthly refreshes

RevenueBase data is refreshed at the beginning of every month. Updates are automatically added to Gigasheet — no action is required on your part.

- Any **saved views** you have created will be dynamically updated at the time of the data refresh. Your filters and logic are preserved; only the underlying data changes.
- If you are receiving a **raw data feed** (S3, Snowflake, etc.), the updated data is delivered to your configured destination at the beginning of the month.
