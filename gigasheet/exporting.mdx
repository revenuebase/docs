# Exporting

Export your filtered or searched RevenueBase data from Gigasheet for use in other tools (CRM, campaigns, etc.).

## How to export

1. In Gigasheet, apply any [Search](/gigasheet/searching) or [Filter](/gigasheet/filtering) to get the rows you want.
2. Use **File** → **Export** or the export option in the toolbar.
3. Choose format (e.g., **CSV**) and optionally which columns to include.
4. Download the file or send it to a connected destination, depending on Gigasheet’s options.

Exported data follows your RevenueBase license terms. Export only what you need for your use case.
