Roll up people-level records to the company level to count contacts per company, prioritize accounts, or layer analysis with nested groups.

## Why grouping matters

Gigasheet defaults to showing people-level records. But sometimes you need to see people rolled up to the company level — for example, to count how many matching contacts exist at each company, or to prioritize accounts.

## How to group

<Steps>
  <Step title="Apply filters (optional)">
    Apply any filters you need so the grouped view shows only the audience you care about.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Open Group and choose Company Name">
    Click the **Group** button (next to the **Filter** button) and select **Company Name** to aggregate your results at a company level.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Nested groups for territory planning, account prioritization & personalization at scale

You can use nested groups to layer your analysis. For example, if you want to know which retail companies have the biggest e-commerce teams:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Run your filter query">
    Find the relevant audience (e.g., retail and e-commerce companies in North America and Europe, with revenue and job title filters).
  </Step>

    alt="Filter dialog for retail and e-commerce with industry, keywords, location, revenue, and job title"
    style={{ maxWidth: '100%', height: 'auto', display: 'block', borderRadius: '0.5rem' }}
  />
</Frame>

  <Step title="Group by company and nest by department">
    Group by **Company Name** and add a nested level (e.g., e-commerce department) to see department size at every company and prioritize accordingly.
  </Step>
</Steps>
