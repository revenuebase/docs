# Gigasheet Access overview

RevenueBase data is available in **Gigasheet** so you can work with large datasets in a spreadsheet-like interface — no SQL required. Use Gigasheet to search, filter, and export RevenueBase contacts and companies, and to run enrichment workflows.

<Info>
  **Subscriptions:** Gigasheet is a flat subscription with unmetered access. The RevenueBase data feeds you use inside Gigasheet (e.g. people + company, enhanced) are separate subscriptions. You can subscribe to Gigasheet and add data feeds, or add Gigasheet to your existing data feed subscription. Contact your account manager for pricing.

## How the data is structured

Gigasheet exposes RevenueBase data in pre-joined tables so you can work without writing SQL or joining rows yourself.

- **People + company** — One table contains all people in the database with company information already joined. You see contact and company fields side by side in a single sheet.
- **Enhanced package** — In the enhanced package, the table includes people, company, and insights joined together. Everything is pre-joined: you get contacts, firmographics, and enrichment signals in one place with no joins required.

## What you can do

- **Search** — Find contacts and companies by name, domain, industry, and other attributes.
- **Filter** — Narrow results with filters on verification status, seniority, company size, and more.
- **Export CSVs** — Download filtered results as CSV or use them in downstream tools.
- **Export to HubSpot** — Send selected rows directly to HubSpot. See [Exporting to HubSpot](/gigasheet/exporting-hubspot) for steps.
- **Enrich your data with RevenueBase data** — Enrich your own lists using RevenueBase data inside Gigasheet.
