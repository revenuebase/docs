# Gigasheet Access overview

RevenueBase data is available in **Gigasheet** so you can work with large datasets in a spreadsheet-like interface — no SQL required. Use Gigasheet to search, filter, and export RevenueBase contacts and companies, and to run enrichment workflows.

## What you can do

- **Search** — Find contacts and companies by name, domain, industry, and other attributes.
- **Filter** — Narrow results with filters on verification status, seniority, company size, and more.
- **Export** — Download filtered results as CSV or use them in downstream tools.
- **Enrichment** — Enrich your own lists using RevenueBase data inside Gigasheet.

## Getting started
