Save your filtered or searched RevenueBase data as a view in Gigasheet so you can return to the same segment later without reapplying filters. Views let you build and reuse segments (e.g. by industry, job function, company size) for export, enrichment, or sharing.

## How to save a view

1. Open your RevenueBase sheet in Gigasheet (people + company or enhanced view).
2. Use the search bar and [Filter](/gigasheet/filtering) to narrow to the contacts or companies you want.
3. Save the current view (e.g. **Save view**, **Save as view**, or your organization’s equivalent in Gigasheet).
4. Name the view so you can find it later. You can return to it anytime without reapplying filters.

Saved views are useful for recurring segments, reporting, or quick access to the same slice of data for [Exporting CSVs](/gigasheet/exporting), [Exporting to HubSpot](/gigasheet/exporting-hubspot), or [enriching your data with RevenueBase data](/gigasheet/enrichment).
