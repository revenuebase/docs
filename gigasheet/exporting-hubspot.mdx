Send RevenueBase contacts and companies from Gigasheet directly into HubSpot so you can build lists, sync to your CRM, or run campaigns without manual CSV uploads.

## Prerequisites

- RevenueBase data loaded in Gigasheet (people + company or enhanced view).
- A HubSpot account and access to create or update contacts and companies.
- Gigasheet connected to HubSpot (or use the HubSpot export option in Gigasheet if available).

## How to export to HubSpot

1. In Gigasheet, apply any search or [Filter](/gigasheet/filtering) to get the rows you want to send to HubSpot.
2. Select the rows (or leave unfiltered to export the current view).
3. Use the **Export** or **Send to** option in the toolbar and choose **HubSpot** (or **Integrations** → **HubSpot**).
4. Map Gigasheet columns to HubSpot fields (e.g., email → HubSpot contact email, company name → HubSpot company name). Gigasheet may remember your mapping for next time.
5. Choose whether to create new records, update existing ones, or both, then confirm the export.

Exported data is subject to your RevenueBase and HubSpot license terms. Export only what you need for your use case.

<Note>
  If your Gigasheet instance uses a different path for HubSpot (e.g., a custom integration or CSV upload into HubSpot), follow the steps provided in Gigasheet or by your admin. Contact support if you don’t see a HubSpot export option.
