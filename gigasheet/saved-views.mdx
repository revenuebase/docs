Save filter and grouping logic as views so you can return to the same segment later without reapplying steps.

## Creating and managing saved views

When you create a filter you want to save and return to later, click **View** and then **Add New View**.

<Tip>
Saved views are **dynamic** — they automatically update every month when the database is refreshed with new data. Any time you click into your view, it will reflect all the filters and logic you added, including any group functions or columns you configured.
</Tip>

## Sharing & managing views

- You can share views with other Gigasheet users on your team.
- To duplicate, update, or manage a view, use the **three-dot menu (⋯)** next to the view name.
