# Searching

Search across RevenueBase contacts and companies directly in Gigasheet.

## How to search

1. Open your RevenueBase sheet in Gigasheet.
2. Use the **Search** bar or **Find** (Ctrl+F / Cmd+F) to search within the sheet.
3. You can search by company name, domain, contact name, email, title, industry, and other columns depending on the dataset.

To narrow results, combine search with [Filtering](/gigasheet/filtering) — for example, search for a keyword and then filter by verification status or employee count.

<Note>
Placeholder: Replace with your actual Gigasheet search behavior (e.g., which columns are searchable, full-text vs column-specific search).
