## FAQs

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can multiple users log in with the same email?">
    No. This breaks the system. Each user must have their own individual email account on a business domain. If you have multiple business domains, you must use the email your account was originally created with — otherwise you won't have the correct account permissions.
