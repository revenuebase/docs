## Add new users to your Gigasheet account

Email **support@gigasheet.com** with the email addresses of the users you want added. The Gigasheet team will add them within 24 hours or less.

## Account & login rules

<Warning>
**One account per email.** Multiple users cannot log in with the same email — this breaks the system. Each user must have their own email account.

**Business email required.** Emails must be on a business domain.

**Consistent email required.** If you have multiple business domains, you must access the platform with the email your account was originally created with. Using a different domain email will result in incorrect account permissions.
</Warning>
