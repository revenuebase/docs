Add team members to Gigasheet so they can access RevenueBase data. User management is done in the Gigasheet application.

## Steps

1. In Gigasheet, open **Settings** or **Team** (or your organization’s equivalent).
2. Click **Add user** or **Invite member**.
3. Enter the user’s email address and assign a role (e.g., Viewer, Editor) as needed.
4. The user receives an invite and can sign in to access the sheets and data they’re permitted to use.

Placeholder: Replace with your actual Gigasheet steps for adding users, roles, and any RevenueBase-specific access settings.
