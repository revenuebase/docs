## How to filter

1. Open your RevenueBase sheet in Gigasheet.
2. Click the column header for the field you want to filter on (e.g., **Industry**, **Verification status**, **Employee count**).
3. Choose **Filter** or the filter icon and set your conditions (e.g., Industry = Software, Verification status = valid).
4. Apply multiple column filters to narrow results further. Clear filters as needed to reset the view.

Common filters for RevenueBase data include verification status, seniority, department, industry, employee count, and location.
