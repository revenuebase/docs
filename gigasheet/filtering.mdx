## Advanced filtering examples

RevenueBase offers 150+ filters. The examples below show how to combine them for real-world use cases.

### Example 1 — Finding SANS-certified cybersecurity teams worldwide

**Use case:** Find all teams in the world that are SANS certified for cybersecurity.

Use the **Filter** dialog to search **Certifications** or **Skills** for "SANS" (with **Contains**), and add a rule so **Email Address** is not empty so you only get contactable people. Connect the certification/skills rules with **or**, then **and** with the email rule.

  />

### Example 2 — Isolating B2B companies by excluding B2C keywords

**Use case:** Filter for B2B companies by removing certain B2C keywords from results.

Use **Does not contain** on **LinkedIn Company**, **LinkedIn Organization**, and **LinkedIn About Us** with B2C-oriented terms (e.g., entertainment, wishlist, consumer, membership, shopping, b2c). Combine with **or** so that any of these fields lacking those terms helps surface B2B companies. Then add **and** rules for employee count, funding type, job title, job level, and persona as needed.

    style={{ maxWidth: '100%', height: 'auto', display: 'block', borderRadius: '0.5rem' }}
  />

### Example 3 — Mining for technologies not in RevenueBase's preset filters

**Use case:** Find companies using a specific technology (e.g., Selenium) that isn't available as a preset filter — by mining current employees' job descriptions and other text fields.

Use the **Filter** dialog with **Contains** on person-level text fields such as **Job Description**, **About Me**, **LinkedIn Headline**, and **Job Title**. Enter the technology name (e.g., "selenium") in each rule and connect them with **or** so a match in any field includes the row.

    alt="Filter dialog searching for Selenium across Job Description, About Me, LinkedIn Headline, and Job Title"
    style={{ maxWidth: '100%', height: 'auto', display: 'block', borderRadius: '0.5rem' }}
