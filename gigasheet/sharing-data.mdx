---

Add a tab in Gigasheet to share RevenueBase data with your team or external stakeholders. Tabs let you organize and expose specific views or filtered datasets without giving full access to the entire sheet.

## Steps

1. In Gigasheet, open the sheet that contains your RevenueBase data (people + company or enhanced view).
2. Use **Add tab** or the tab bar to create a new tab (naming it e.g. **Shared view** or **Sales list**).
3. In the new tab, apply the search and [Filter](/gigasheet/filtering) you want to share — e.g. a segment by industry, region, or job level.
4. Optionally hide columns that shouldn’t be shared (e.g. internal notes) using column visibility or **Manage columns**.
5. Share the tab or sheet via Gigasheet’s sharing options (e.g. invite by email, share link, or embed) so others see only that tab’s filtered view.

<Note>
  Placeholder: Replace with your actual Gigasheet steps for adding tabs and sharing (e.g. tab settings, link permissions, or RevenueBase-specific sharing rules).
