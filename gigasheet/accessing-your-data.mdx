## How to log in and access your data

1. Go to your Gigasheet URL (provided by your admin or RevenueBase when your subscription is set up).
2. Log in with your credentials. If you use SSO or a custom domain, use the sign-in option your organization has configured.
3. After signing in, you’ll see your workspace. Open the sheet or dataset that contains your RevenueBase data (e.g. people + company or enhanced view).
4. You can now search, [filter](/gigasheet/filtering), [save views](/gigasheet/saving-views), [export](/gigasheet/exporting), and [enrich your data with RevenueBase data](/gigasheet/enrichment) as needed.

If you don’t have a Gigasheet login or don’t see RevenueBase data, contact your account manager or admin to confirm your subscription and access.
