Use Gigasheet to upload your own list of people (for example, LinkedIn URLs) and enrich it with RevenueBase contact and firmographic data — job title, company name, email, cell phone, and more. Match on LinkedIn URL, domain, or email; then pull in the columns you need.

## How contact enrichment works

**Use case:** You have a list of people (e.g., LinkedIn URLs) and want to enrich it with contact information and firmographic data from RevenueBase.

**Example:** Upload 100 LinkedIn URLs, then enrich with job title, company name, email, and cell phone.

### Step 1: Create a RevenueBase sheet with your match column

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add a new RevenueBase sheet">
    In Gigasheet, go to **RevenueBase** and click **Add New**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose sheet type">
    Create a **LinkedIn person URL** sheet (or the sheet type that matches your data — e.g., domain, email).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Upload identifiers">
    Upload or paste your identifiers (LinkedIn URLs, domains, or emails) into that sheet.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm data">
    Open the sheet and confirm your data is loaded.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Step 2: Match your format to RevenueBase

Your upload format must **exactly match** how RevenueBase stores the same field. Otherwise matches will fail.

- **LinkedIn URLs:** Use `https://` with the full URL and **no trailing slash**.
- **Domains and emails:** Use the same format RevenueBase uses in its published data.

Check a few rows in an existing RevenueBase sheet to see the exact pattern, then make your list identical.

### Step 3: Run Crossfile lookup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Crossfile lookup">
    Go to **Insert** → **Crossfile v Lookup**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select your match column">
    Select the **column in your file** that you want to match (e.g., the column containing LinkedIn URLs).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select the RevenueBase file">
    **Browse** to the RevenueBase file that contains the same identifier type and choose the **match column** (e.g., **LinkedIn URL Person**).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose match and return options">
    Select **NearMatch** to allow for case or minor formatting differences. Choose **which columns to return** (e.g., full name, email, job title, company name, cell phone). You can select any columns available in the RevenueBase file.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Apply">
    Click **Apply** and wait for enrichment to complete.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Step 4: Wait for enrichment to complete

- While the job is running, the file area **grays out** at the top.
- When enrichment is done, the new values appear in **blue** and the file becomes active again.

### Step 5: Use your enriched data

From the enriched sheet you can download the file, save it for later, or keep working in Gigasheet.

<Tip>
- Use **NearMatch** when your identifiers might differ slightly in case or formatting.
- Any column visible in the RevenueBase file can be selected as a return value for enrichment.
- Enrichment is useful for filling gaps in your CRM, verifying emails, or adding firmographic and contact data to prospect lists.

</div>

### Step-by-step summary

<Steps>
  <Step title="Upload your file">
    In the Gigasheet navigation bar, go to **My Files** → **Add New** and upload an Excel/CSV file of domains (or other unique identifiers). Domains must match RevenueBase's formatting exactly — no `www.`, no `https://`, no trailing slashes (e.g., `aheadoftime.com`, not `www.aheadoftime.com`).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Open your RevenueBase file">
    Go to **Shared with Me** in the Gigasheet navigation bar and select your RevenueBase data file.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Apply a Found in Sheet filter">
    Click the **Filter** button, select the unique identifier you want to match on (e.g., **Organization Domain**), set the operator to **Found in Sheet**, and browse to select the file you just uploaded. Choose the matching column and click **Apply**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Layer on additional filters">
    Add filters for job titles, seniority, or other person-level attributes to narrow down to the exact personnel you need.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Export">
    Once your audience is refined, export as needed.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
You can also match on other unique identifiers, such as Company Name + Headquarter Location (useful when multiple companies share a name), or Company LinkedIn URL.
