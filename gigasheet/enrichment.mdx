# Enrichment

Use RevenueBase data in Gigasheet to enrich your own lists — add or update contact and company attributes by matching on email, domain, or other keys.

## How enrichment works

1. Upload or open your list in Gigasheet (e.g., a sheet with company domains or contact emails).
2. Use Gigasheet’s **Enrichment** or **Lookup** feature (or the RevenueBase integration) to match your rows to RevenueBase.
3. Map the match key (e.g., domain, email) and choose which RevenueBase fields to pull in (title, company name, industry, verification status, etc.).
4. Run the enrichment; new columns are added or updated with RevenueBase data for matched rows.

Enrichment is useful for filling gaps in your CRM, verifying emails, or adding firmographic and contact data to prospect lists.

Placeholder: Replace with your actual Gigasheet + RevenueBase enrichment workflow, match keys, and available fields.
