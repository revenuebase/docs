Use Gigasheet to upload your own list of people (for example, LinkedIn URLs) and enrich it with RevenueBase contact and firmographic data — job title, company name, email, cell phone, and more. Match on LinkedIn URL, domain, or email; then pull in the columns you need.

## How contact enrichment works

**Use case:** You have a list of people (e.g., LinkedIn URLs) and want to enrich it with contact information and firmographic data from RevenueBase.

**Example:** Upload 100 LinkedIn URLs, then enrich with job title, company name, email, and cell phone.

### Step 1: Create a RevenueBase sheet with your match column

1. In Gigasheet, go to **RevenueBase** (via the data source or LinkedIn entry point) and click **Add New**.
2. Create a **LinkedIn person URL** sheet (or the sheet type that matches your data — e.g., domain, email).
3. Upload or paste your identifiers (LinkedIn URLs, domains, or emails) into that sheet.
4. Open the sheet and confirm your data is loaded.

### Step 2: Match your format to RevenueBase

Your upload format must **exactly match** how RevenueBase stores the same field. Otherwise matches will fail.

- **LinkedIn URLs:** Use `https://` with the full URL and **no trailing slash**.
- **Domains and emails:** Use the same format RevenueBase uses in its published data.

Check a few rows in an existing RevenueBase sheet to see the exact pattern, then make your list identical.

### Step 3: Run Crossfile lookup

1. Go to **Insert** → **Crossfile v Lookup**.
2. Select the **column in your file** that you want to match (e.g., the column containing LinkedIn URLs).
3. **Browse** to the RevenueBase file that contains the same identifier type.
4. Choose the **match column** in the RevenueBase file (e.g., **LinkedIn URL Person**).
5. Select **NearMatch** to allow for case or minor formatting differences.
6. Choose **which columns to return** (e.g., full name, email, job title, company name, cell phone). You can select any columns available in the RevenueBase file.
7. Click **Apply**.

### Step 4: Wait for enrichment to complete

- While the job is running, the file area **grays out** at the top.
- When enrichment is done, the new values appear in **blue** and the file becomes active again.

### Step 5: Use your enriched data

From the enriched sheet you can download the file, save it for later, or keep working in Gigasheet.

## Tips

- Use **NearMatch** when your identifiers might differ slightly in case or formatting.
- Any column visible in the RevenueBase file can be selected as a return value for enrichment.
- Enrichment is useful for filling gaps in your CRM, verifying emails, or adding firmographic and contact data to prospect lists.
