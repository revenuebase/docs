## Quickstart (API)

Use this guide to get an API key and make your first request to the RevenueBase API.

<Warning>
  **Create an account first.** You must have a RevenueBase account before you can use the API. If you don't have one yet, go to [https://app.revenuebase.ai/](https://app.revenuebase.ai/) to create an account, then return here to get your API key.
</Warning>

### Step 1: Get your API key

1. Sign in to the [RevenueBase dashboard](https://app.revenuebase.ai/dashboard).
2. Open **Settings** → **API Keys**.
3. Click **Create API key** and copy the key. Store it securely. You can view and copy the key anytime from the dashboard.

<Note>
Keep your API key secret. Do not commit it to version control or expose it in client-side code.
</Note>

### Step 2: Authenticate requests

Send your API key in the `x-key` header on every request:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.revenuebase.ai/v1/credits" \
  -H "x-key: YOUR_API_KEY"
```

### Step 3: Call an endpoint

Example: check your credit balance:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.revenuebase.ai/v1/credits" \
  -H "x-key: YOUR_API_KEY"
```

Example response:

```json
{
  "credits": 1000
}
```
