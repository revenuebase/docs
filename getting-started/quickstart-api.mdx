Get an API key and make your first request.

<Warning>
  **Create an account first.** You must have a RevenueBase account before you can use the API. If you don't have one yet, go to <a href="https://app.revenuebase.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://app.revenuebase.ai/</a> to create an account, then return here to get your API key.
</Warning>

### Step 1: Get your API key

1. Sign in to the <a href="https://app.revenuebase.ai/dashboard" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RevenueBase dashboard</a>.
2. Open **Settings** → **API Keys**.
3. Click **Create API key** and copy the key. Store it securely. You can view and copy the key anytime from the dashboard.

<Note>
Keep your API key secret. Do not commit it to version control or expose it in client-side code.
</Note>

### Step 2: Make your first request

Send your API key in the `x-key` header and call an endpoint. Example: check your credit balance:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.revenuebase.ai/v1/credits" \
  -H "x-key: YOUR_API_KEY"
```

Example response:

```json
{
  "credits": 1000
}
```
