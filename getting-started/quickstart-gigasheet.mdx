# Quickstart (Gigasheet)

Get up and running with RevenueBase data in Gigasheet in a few steps.

## Prerequisites

- A RevenueBase account with Gigasheet access enabled.
- Access to Gigasheet (invite or login provided by your admin).

## Step 1: Open Gigasheet and connect to RevenueBase

1. Log in to [Gigasheet](https://gigasheet.com) (or your organization’s Gigasheet URL).
2. Create a new sheet or open an existing one and connect to the RevenueBase data source (e.g., **Add data** → **RevenueBase** or equivalent).
3. Authenticate with your RevenueBase credentials or SSO if prompted. Once connected, your licensed RevenueBase dataset is available as a sheet or data source.

## Step 2: Explore your data

- Your sheet will show RevenueBase contacts and/or companies depending on your license.
- Use the column headers to see available fields (name, email, company, industry, verification status, etc.).

## Step 3: Search, filter, or enrich

- **Search** — Use the search bar to find contacts or companies by name, domain, or other attributes.
- **Filter** — Apply filters on columns to build targeted lists. See [Filtering](/gigasheet/filtering).
- **Export** — Export filtered results to CSV or another format. See [Exporting](/gigasheet/exporting).
- **Enrich your data with RevenueBase data** — Enrich your own uploads with RevenueBase data. See [Enrich your data with RevenueBase data](/gigasheet/enrichment).

## Next steps
