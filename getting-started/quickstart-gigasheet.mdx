Get up and running in a few steps.

## Prerequisites

- A RevenueBase account with Gigasheet access enabled. Need access? Contact your account manager or **support@revenuebase.ai**.
- Access to Gigasheet (invite or login provided by your admin).

## Step 1: Open Gigasheet and access your RevenueBase data

1. Log in to <a href="https://gigasheet.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gigasheet</a> (or your organization's Gigasheet URL if one was provided).
2. Under **Workspaces**, open the **Shared with me** section. Your RevenueBase file is listed there — click it to open your licensed dataset.
3. If you were not given a Gigasheet URL, you can go to <a href="https://gigasheet.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gigasheet</a>, log in, and navigate to **Workspaces** → **Shared with me** to find the RevenueBase file on your own.

## Step 2: Explore your data

- Your sheet will show RevenueBase contacts and/or companies depending on your license.
- Use the column headers to see available fields (name, email, company, industry, verification status, etc.).

## Step 3: Search, filter, or enrich

- **Search** — Use the search bar to find contacts or companies by name, domain, or other attributes.
- **Filter** — Apply filters on columns to build targeted lists. See [Filtering](/gigasheet/filtering).
- **Export** — Export filtered results to CSV or another format. See [Exporting](/gigasheet/exporting).
- **Enrich your data with RevenueBase data** — Enrich your own uploads with RevenueBase data. See [Enrich your data with RevenueBase data](/gigasheet/enrichment).
