Choose how you want to access RevenueBase data and follow the steps below.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Data Feeds">
    RevenueBase **Dynamic Data Feeds** deliver structured B2B data (contacts, companies, and insights)
    to you in two ways: data is available in our **S3 bucket** (we grant your AWS account access),
    or we share it through **Snowflake Data Sharing** to your Snowflake account.
    Updates are delivered on a **monthly** cadence. The full [Data Feeds overview](/data-feeds/overview) has step-by-step onboarding for each
    delivery method.

    ## Choose your delivery method

    <CardGroup cols={2}>
      <Card title="AWS S3" icon="cloud" href="/data-feeds/overview">
        Data is available in our S3 bucket. We grant your AWS account access so you can list and download
        date-stamped delivery folders. When you get S3 access, you get access to all three formats:
        CSV, JSON, and Parquet.
      </Card>
      <Card title="Snowflake" icon="database" href="/data-feeds/overview">
        We share the data through **Data Sharing** to your Snowflake account. You get a database (e.g. **RELEASES**)
        with tables you can query directly in SQL.
      </Card>
    </CardGroup>

    <Info>
      **Custom locations** — We can make data available in custom locations beyond S3 and Snowflake.
      We can support almost any location; contact **support@revenuebase.ai** to discuss your requirements.
      There may be an additional cost.
    </Info>

    ## Get your first data in three steps

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Share details with RevenueBase">
        **S3:** Provide your 12-digit **AWS Account ID**. You get access to all three formats (CSV, JSON, Parquet)
        when access is provisioned. **Snowflake:** Provide your **Snowflake Account Locator**, region, and account
        URL. See <a href="https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/admin-account-identifier" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
        Snowflake's account identifier documentation</a> for where to find this information.
        Contact your RevenueBase onboarding contact or **support@revenuebase.ai** to get started.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Get access">
        **S3:** You'll receive a bucket alias (or ARN) and region. **Snowflake:** We'll add you to the Data Sharing listing; accept the share via Data Sharing and add the **RELEASES** database to your account.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Verify and query">
        **S3:** Use the AWS CLI with `--request-payer requester` to list your delivery folder (see [Data Feeds overview](/data-feeds/overview) for exact commands). **Snowflake:** Run a query such as `SELECT * FROM RELEASES.RELEASE.PER_LATEST LIMIT 100;`
      </Step>
    </Steps>

    <Warning>
      Use the **AWS CLI** for S3 access — not the AWS Console. The Console does not support `--request-payer requester` and will return access errors.
    </Warning>

  <Tab title="Gigasheet">
    Log in, open your RevenueBase file, and start exploring in a few steps.

    ## Prerequisites

    - A RevenueBase account with Gigasheet access enabled. Need access? Contact your account manager or **support@revenuebase.ai**.
    - Access to Gigasheet (invite or login provided by your admin).

    ## Open your RevenueBase file

    1. Log in to <a href="https://gigasheet.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gigasheet</a> (or your organization's Gigasheet URL if one was provided).
    2. Under **Workspaces**, open the **Shared with me** section. Your RevenueBase file is listed there — click it to open your licensed dataset.
    3. If you were not given a Gigasheet URL, go to <a href="https://gigasheet.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gigasheet</a>, log in, and navigate to **Workspaces** → **Shared with me** to find the RevenueBase file.

    ## Explore your data

    - Your sheet will show RevenueBase contacts and/or companies depending on your license.
    - Use the column headers to see available fields (name, email, company, industry, verification status, etc.).

    ## Next steps

    - Read the [Gigasheet overview](/gigasheet/overview) to learn about all the features.
      - [**Add Users**](/gigasheet/adding-users) - Add your team member to the dataset.
      - [**Filter**](/gigasheet/filtering) — Apply filters on columns to build targeted lists.
      - [**Export**](/gigasheet/exporting) — Export filtered results to CSV or another format.
      - [**Enrich**](/gigasheet/enrichment) — Enrich your own uploads with RevenueBase data.

  <Tab title="API">
    Get an API key and make your first request.

    <Warning>
      **Create an account first.** You must have a RevenueBase account before you can use the API. If you don't have one yet, go to <a href="https://app.revenuebase.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://app.revenuebase.ai/</a> to create an account, then return here to get your API key.
    </Warning>

    ## Step 1: Get your API key

    1. Sign in to the <a href="https://app.revenuebase.ai/dashboard" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RevenueBase dashboard</a>.
    2. Open **Settings** → **API Keys**.
    3. Click **Create API key** and copy the key. Store it securely.

    <Note>
      Keep your API key secret. Do not commit it to version control or expose it in client-side code.
    </Note>

    ## Step 2: Make your first request

    Send your API key in the `x-key` header. Example — check your credit balance:

    ```bash
    curl -X GET "https://api.revenuebase.ai/v1/credits" \
      -H "x-key: YOUR_API_KEY"
    ```

    Example response:

    ```json
    {
      "credits": 1000
    }
    ```

    ## Next steps

    - Explore the [API Reference](/api-reference/authentication) to learn about our endpoints.
    - Get an API key and [Authenticate](/api-reference/authentication) with our API.
    - Read more on [Rate limits and error codes](/api-reference/rate-limits) before going to production.
