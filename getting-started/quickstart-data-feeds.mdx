RevenueBase **Dynamic Data Feeds** deliver structured B2B data (contacts, companies, and insights) 
to you in two ways: data is available in our **S3 bucket** (we grant your AWS account access), 
or we share it through **Snowflake Data Sharing** to your Snowflake account. 
Updates are delivered on a **monthly** cadence. This quickstart gets you oriented; 
the full [Data Feeds overview](/data-feeds/overview) has step-by-step onboarding for each 
delivery method.

## Choose your delivery method

RevenueBase supports two ways to receive your feed:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="AWS S3" icon="cloud" href="/data-feeds/overview">
    Data is available in our S3 bucket. We grant your AWS account access so you can list and download 
    date-stamped delivery folders. When you get S3 access, you get access to all three formats: 
    CSV, JSON, and Parquet.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Snowflake" icon="database" href="/data-feeds/overview">
    We share the data through **Data Sharing** to your Snowflake account. You get a database (e.g. **RELEASES**) 
    with tables you can query directly in SQL.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Info>
  **Custom locations** — We can make data available in custom locations beyond S3 and Snowflake. 
  We can support almost any location; contact **support@revenuebase.ai** to discuss your requirements. 
  There may be an additional cost.

## Get your first data in three steps

<Steps>
  <Step title="Share details with RevenueBase">
    **S3:** Provide your 12-digit **AWS Account ID**. You get access to all three formats (CSV, JSON, Parquet) 
    when access is provisioned. **Snowflake:** Provide your **Snowflake Account Locator**, region, and account 
    URL. See <a href="https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/admin-account-identifier" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
    Snowflake's account identifier documentation</a> for where to find this information. 
    Contact your RevenueBase onboarding contact or **support@revenuebase.ai** to get started.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Get access">
    **S3:** You’ll receive bucket alias (or ARN), region. **Snowflake:** We’ll add you to the Data Sharing listing; accept the share via Data Sharing and add the **RELEASES** database to your account.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify and query">
    **S3:** Use the AWS CLI with `--request-payer requester` to list your delivery folder (see [Data Feeds overview](/data-feeds/overview) for exact commands). **Snowflake:** Run a query such as `SELECT * FROM RELEASES.RELEASE.PER_LATEST LIMIT 100;`
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
Use the **AWS CLI** for S3 access — not the AWS Console. The Console does not support `--request-payer requester` and will return access errors.
</Warning>

## What you’ll see in your feed

Depending on your subscription, your feed includes person-level data (`per`), organization data (`org`), insights, and optionally pre-joined tables (people and companies, or people, companies, and insights). Each monthly update creates a **new** delivery (new S3 folder or refreshed Snowflake tables); previous deliveries remain available. See the [Data Feeds overview](/data-feeds/overview) for table names, paths, and the full onboarding flow.
