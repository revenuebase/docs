RevenueBase **Dynamic Data Feeds** deliver structured B2B data (contacts, companies, and insights) to you in two ways: data is available in our **S3 bucket** (we grant your AWS account access), or we share it through the **Snowflake Marketplace** to your Snowflake account. Updates are delivered on a **monthly** cadence. This quickstart gets you oriented; the full [Data Feeds overview](/data-feeds/overview) has step-by-step onboarding for each delivery method.

## Choose your delivery method

RevenueBase supports two ways to receive your feed:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="AWS S3" icon="cloud" href="/data-feeds/overview">
    Data is available in our S3 bucket. We grant your AWS account access so you can list and download date-stamped delivery folders (CSV, JSON, or Parquet) via the AWS CLI.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Snowflake" icon="database" href="/data-feeds/overview">
    We share the data through the **Snowflake Marketplace** to your Snowflake account. You get a database (e.g. **RELEASES**) with tables you can query directly in SQL.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Quick path to your first data

<Steps>
  <Step title="Share details with RevenueBase">
    **S3:** Provide your 12-digit **AWS Account ID** and preferred file format (CSV, JSON, or Parquet). **Snowflake:** Provide your **Snowflake Account Locator**, region, and account URL. Contact your RevenueBase onboarding contact or **support@revenuebase.ai** to get started.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Get access">
    **S3:** You’ll receive bucket alias (or ARN), region, and AWS credentials. **Snowflake:** We’ll add you to the marketplace listing; accept the share in the Snowflake Marketplace and add the **RELEASES** database to your account.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify and query">
    **S3:** Use the AWS CLI with `--request-payer requester` to list your delivery folder (see [Data Feeds overview](/data-feeds/overview) for exact commands). **Snowflake:** Run a query such as `SELECT * FROM RELEASES.RELEASE.PER_LATEST LIMIT 100;`
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
Use the **AWS CLI** for S3 access — not the AWS Console. The Console does not support `--request-payer requester` and will return access errors.
</Warning>

## What you’ll see in your feed

Depending on your subscription, your feed includes person-level data (`per`), organization data (`org`), insights, and optionally pre-joined tables (people and companies, or people, companies, and insights). Each monthly update creates a **new** delivery (new S3 folder or refreshed Snowflake tables); previous deliveries remain available. See the [Data Feeds overview](/data-feeds/overview) for table names, paths, and the full onboarding flow.
