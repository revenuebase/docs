This guide gets you connected so you can query tables and join data.

### Step 1: Enable data feeds access

1. Sign in to the [RevenueBase dashboard](https://app.revenuebase.ai/dashboard).
2. Ensure your plan includes **Data Feeds**.
3. Note your feed credentials (host, database, and auth) from **Settings** → **Data Feeds**.

### Step 2: Connect your client

Use the connection details from the dashboard. Example (replace placeholders with your values):

```bash
# Example: connect via provided client or JDBC/ODBC
# Host: feed.revenuebase.ai
# Port: 443
# Database: your_database
# Auth: your_feed_username / your_feed_password
```

<Note>
Credentials are unique per account. Do not share them or commit them to version control.
</Note>

### Step 3: Run a sample query

Once connected, try a simple query against a core table (see [Tables & Schema](/data-feeds/tables-schema) for exact table names):

```sql
SELECT * FROM companies LIMIT 10;
```

### Next steps

- Read the [Data Feeds overview](/data-feeds/overview).
- Follow [Getting started with feeds](/data-feeds/getting-started-feeds) for more detail.
- Use the [Data dictionary](/data-feeds/data-dictionary) and [Joining tables](/data-feeds/joining-tables) when building queries.
